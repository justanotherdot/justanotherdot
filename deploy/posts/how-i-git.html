          <p>I thought it might be worth having a look at two things <code>git</code> allows I've abused
to remove some warts and toil from my day-to-day flow.</p>
<p>One thing <code>git</code> does is alias support. Anything under the <code>[alias]</code> key in ones
<code>$HOME/.gitconfig</code> is treated as a valid subcommand. This is fine for quick
things, like <code>r</code> as <code>rebase</code> or <code>a</code> for <code>add</code>, but you can also alias one-line
scripts, for example, here's a snippet from my <code>.gitconfig</code>.</p>
<pre><code>  it = &quot;!f() { git fp &amp;&amp; git r origin/master; }; f&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This demonstrates defining an ad hoc shell function named <code>f</code> and calling it
immediately. What's notable about this is that it is <em>also</em> calling a <code>git</code>
alias. <code>git fp</code> in this case is an alias for <code>git fetch --prune</code> and <code>r</code> we've
already mentioned is <code>rebase</code>, so this, verbosely, is,</p>
<pre><code>$ git fetch --prune &amp;&amp; git rebase origin/master
</code></pre>
<p>Another thing <code>git</code> let's you do is invoke arbitrary scripts that are named in
the format <code>git-name</code>. If the script is on the path, you can call <code>git name</code> and
the script, <code>git-name</code>, will run. My old process for pushing to a branch I had
authored was a bit verbose,</p>
<pre><code># on first push
$ git push -u origin/master current-branch

# afterwards ...
$ git fetch --prune

# and, after hacking, changes both behind + ahead on branch (rewritten history)
$ git push --force-with-lease

# or, if simply, without any `--force*` flag
$ git push
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote a script that does all of this, automatically, called
<a href="https://github.com/justanotherdot/gits/blob/master/scripts/git-p"><code>git-p</code></a>,
which lets me call <code>git p</code>. It's doesn't work for all corner cases, and could be
extended to, but this fits ninety-nine percent of my use case. This worked well
for awhile, but I needed to build on it. I eventually wrote an alias called <code>git up</code>,</p>
<pre><code>  up = &quot;!f() { git it &amp;&amp; git p; }; f&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The point of <code>up</code> is to ensure my changes are always rebased on master before I
push. This is pretty handy but I've recently added yet another alias called
<code>raise</code> (also aliased as <code>pr</code>),</p>
<pre><code>  raise = &quot;!f() { git up 2&gt;&amp;1 | awk '/http/ { print $2 }' | xargs open; }; f&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This scrapes out the remote output with the PR creation link that GitHub
provides after a branch is first pushed to the remote repository and funnels it
into <code>open</code>. MacOS X has <code>open</code> as the default way to open mime-type related
files to respective 'default' applications. On linux, where I use the gnome
windows manager, I have the shell alias,</p>
<pre><code>$ which open
open: aliased to xdg-open
</code></pre>
<p>to try to bridge the gap, which just goes to show aliases and scripts that use
this same format can be really handy for hiding away toil! I don't know if it's
ideal for all CLI tooling but I think this approach is certainly an interesting
approach to let people slip in their own functionality and 'rewire' an interface
to better suit their needs.</p>
