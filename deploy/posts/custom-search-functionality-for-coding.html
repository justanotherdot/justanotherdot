thought I'd write about since it's managed to surprise enough colleagues and

<p>Firefox and Chrome both support this functionality but are setup differently.
Let's say you have a github codebase with a particular org (which are also,
confusingly, demarcated as users in github search). You want to find a repo
quickly; you can quickly go to your search bar and hit <code>repos a_project</code> (or in
the case of Chrome, <code>repos&lt;tab&gt; a_project</code>), hammer the enter key and you wind
up at <code>https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aorg+a_project</code>. How?</p>
<p>In both Chrome and Firefox, you can add a custom search engine by right-clicking
on the search 'bar' (form) you'd like to add, except in Firefox the mechanism
works via bookmarks and Chrome has the functionality as it's own thing (seems
like a first class citizen). There <em>are</em> custom search engines for Firefox you
can add (I've noticed I can add them for things like crates.io, docs.rs, amazon,
et. al.) out of the box given a specific version (I'm not sure which) of Firefox
but you'll still need to bookmark approach for most cases. Once you have the
search URL you care about just replace the term you searched for with <code>%s</code> and
all is well, e.g. <code>https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aorg+%s</code>.</p>
<p>Some other examples of uses are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>code term</code> - similar to the <code>repos</code> keyword above but searches across all
repositories of an org for <code>term</code></li>
<li><code>(docs.rs|crates.rs|younameit) &lt;module&gt;</code> - looks for module documentation,
listing in some large store of knowledge</li>
<li><code>rstd term</code> - search for <code>term</code> in the rust std lib (handy when paired with
something like rust-tags so you can jump to definition inside of std in your
editor)</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are rust centric because it's what I've been in the headspace of but
you could easily set this up for things like hoogle, amazon, shortening things
like youtube to <code>y</code>, <code>hex.pm</code>, and so on. Personally, it's been empowering to
gain a handle on parameterizing search functionality with your address bar.</p>
