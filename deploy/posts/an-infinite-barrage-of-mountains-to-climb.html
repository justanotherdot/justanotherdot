              <p>This Tuesday I went to my last therapy session for the year. In that session I
finalized a relapse prevention program for my obsessive compulsive disorder and
recapped strategies I learned to handle various stressors in my life.</p>
<p>I’m one of those exuberant but actually shy people. I love reading and
programming because I’d rather be in an internet-equipped mountain cabin away
from the rest of civilization than on a boat in the Caribbean partying. I spend
a great deal of time honing skills through study and experimentation. The
studying has, and sometimes still, makes me anxious and exhausted.</p>
<p>A <em>lot</em> of people experience this; they learn new thing after new thing and when
the mountain seems climbed and truly conquered they look up again only to reveal
a new mountain waiting for them to ascend. If only they climb that next one will
they truly be done. It is a lie. There is never an end to the mountains.</p>
<p>This hurdle of seemingly endless mountains is partly why people feel constant
imposter syndrome. I do. I also feel imposter syndrome when I am full of
self-criticism by attaching my self worth to my productivity. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=thought+challenging">Thought
challenging</a> is a
convenient way to question the validity and usefulness of the thoughts we might
encounter that attempt to undermine us. If the thoughts still plague us despite
challenging them, it can also help to try <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=thought+defusion">thought
defusion</a> where one displaces
the importance of a thought, or thoughts, to something less dominant by various
means. For example I sometimes imagine someone whom I would not trust their
advice as saying the plaguing thoughts to me. This makes it easy to ignore the
thought then. I know it's there, but like a hand on my lap instead of a hand in
front of my face, I barely notice it's presence.</p>
<p>Education matters and in a technical field it is unavoidable. If you don’t want
to stagnate you need to keep pushing to improve your skills and knowledge.
Pushing towards discomfort is good! It is the essence of growth to push until we
are uncomfortable. But <em>continually</em> pushing towards things until the bucket of
energy is dry withers away at who we are. We can become not only paranoid from
the rampant thoughts of imposter syndrome but also burned out from our desire to
improve. Rest is a crucial part of the process. Get uncomfortable for a bit,
take a breather, repeat.</p>
<p>Full disclaimer: I am not a medical professional of any kind. All I can do is
try to share some things I've learned that were prescribed and work for me.
Writing this article is more for reminder than it is for sharing. I give no
warranty as to the use of anything said in the entirety of this article. If you
are able to attend therapy and think it might benefit you in any way, shape, or
form, by all means you should try to attend. Getting personalised support is
best. With that said, How do I learn and stay healthy these days? Here's some
things I've picked up in my time wandering around:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>You are not your work.</strong> Your work is its own thing. If you are your work you
can not have a critical, and therefore healthy, stance towards it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you don't feel dumb you aren't learning and everyone who is learning
feels dumb.</strong> You need to pursue this feeling all the while reminding
yourself that everyone feels this and it does not signify that they, or you,
are a dumb person. As they say, it's not about being right but knowing the
truth. People who are always right don't go through this process and don't
actually obtain any deep understanding or learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compare yourself to yourself.</strong> Your history is yours alone and it isn't
logical to try to cookie-cutter other people's tales onto your own. Track
your improvements not by comparing yourself to others but by comparing
yourself to your past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Life itself is not work.</strong> Some people might argue that it's OK to dump all
your time into studying or hacking on side projects or whatever but the
reality is we need different entertainment for our brains and we need to give
it rest. Simply &quot;taking a holiday&quot; from your studying or work where you do
literally nothing is a fantastic way to replenish your excitement for the
things you are passionate about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Excitement is healthy and an absence of it is a warning flag.</strong> It helps
clarify what you want to concentrate your efforts on. Yes, sometimes things
will be boring when you learn about a topic but that doesn't mean you have to
read the entirety of Donald Knuth’s <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> to make
a program (although it certainly might help). If you can make the task at
hand fun you will probably replenish your store of energy all the while
<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/4141/the-neuroscience-joyful-education-judy-willis-md.pdf">retaining information more
effectively</a>.
Doesn't this contradict my argument that we need to get to the state of
discomfort to grow? Not quite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Questions can be fun.</strong> Having a healthy sense to question everything is
what makes people smart. We want to tirelessly get at the truth but the
process of getting there need not be a slog through a muggy swamp on a hot
summer afternoon. You may have had that giddy moment exclaiming &quot;Aha! It
works! But <em>why</em>?!&quot; and whiled away another stream of hours on the problem,
and resulting problems, at hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility is a key to happiness.</strong> Rigidity towards expectations on
ourselves and others can lead to a lot of misery. Accepting that things don't
always go to plan and that life is messy goes a long way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There's always another mountain and it <em>is</em> daunting but hopefully something
I've said here will help make overcoming it, and the chatter of self doubt that
tends to comes with it, easier.</p>
