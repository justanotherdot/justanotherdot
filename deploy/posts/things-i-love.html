        <div class="content">
          <p>It has taken me awhile to summarise 2022. I intended to finish writing my book,
&quot;Just Perf&quot;, but family took precedence, as it always should. Instead, I
drastically improved my curation skills, and did get a lot of writing practice
in, while also honing my craft at work. </p>
<p>Admittedly, I was feeling a bit burnt-out, as one does from time to time working
in tech, and I decided at the start of 2022 that I would commit to making the
things I love <em>explicit</em>. Every time I found something I loved, into a note it
went. Bear has this neat functionality on mobile I use a lot, where the <code>share</code>
functionality can be chosen to append to the end of a note. This is handy for
general link dumping, but in this case it it allowed me to focus media to a
particular bucket, as you can edit the text before dumping if you want. Doing
this sharpened my sensibilities, and I've since taken the practice for other
things in my life that I want to be sure of what is uniquely <em>me</em> and not simply
me copying others templates. I also had read The Practice by Seth Godin in which
he has a small section dedicated to adopting an abundance mindset; I love the
idea of holding onto an abundance mindset now, and I think hoarding a treasure
trove of what I love is the wrong thing to do, hence I am here sharing it with
you, dear reader.</p>
<p>It is now nearing the end of of the first month of 2023, and I felt it
appropriate to get on with it and share this list. Things will inevitably
change, and this list may contian things I will fall out of love with, but
that's ok; I'm human and I'm growing. I will gradually refine this list to more
than a link dump as a I revisit the content and reflect. I will be repeating
this process again, and, indeed, there are some links at the tail end of this
list that were thrown in this January. Hopefully you can mind a bit of my mess
as I clean things up in public, but feel free to come back and see how things
have changed. This foreword will likely adapt as time goes on, too. We need more
living documents.</p>
<p><strong>NB.</strong> <em>With the inevitable collapse of twitter on its way, many of these twitter
links will be converted into screenshots for posterity. I also am keen on the
idea that if it doesn't fit in a screenshot or two, I don't think it's small
enough to love.</em></p>
<p>Without further ado:</p>

<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôre only as strong as the people around us let us be. Which is why it
matters that we can now shape our power, by shaping our community and context.
Where is it you can be you? Who does that for you? When you realize identity
is fluid, contextual and shapes what you can do, you can also put yourself
into a context that enables all of you. - Nilofer Merchant</p>

<blockquote>
<p>yeh, also we're blind to abuse from people we admire -Max Rozen</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A key engineering skill is noticing what‚Äôs blocked, and figuring out why,
following a thread of hints from person to person until you can see what‚Äôs not
moving. You might end up asking the same question again and again. You might
get handwavy responses that seem like answers but don‚Äôt actually give you
extra information. That‚Äôs how these games go.<br />

<blockquote>
<p>Base your priorities on company priorities and be relentless about revisiting
them. A clear understanding of priority will help clarify which projects to
start, stop, abandon or finish. And it‚Äôll help avoid the worst scenario where
your team does great work on an ultimately meaningless task.<br />

<blockquote>
<p>At Google, one of our favorite mottos is that ‚ÄúFailure is an option.‚Äù It‚Äôs
widely recognized that if you‚Äôre not failing now and then, you‚Äôre not being
innovative enough or taking enough risks. Failure is viewed as a golden
opportunity to learn and improve for the next go-around. 7 In fact, Thomas
Edison is often quoted as saying, ‚ÄúIf I find 10,000 ways something won‚Äôt work,
I haven‚Äôt failed. I am not discouraged, because every wrong attempt discarded
is another step forward.‚Äù - SWE At Google (Book)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So one effective thing you can do if you want to think better is to <strong>become
better at probing other people‚Äôs thinking</strong>. Ask questions. Simple ones are
better. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù is the best. If you ask that three or four times you get to a
place where you‚Äôre going to understand more and you‚Äôll be able to tell who
really knows what they are talking about. Shortcuts in thinking are easy, and
this is how you tease them out. Not to make the other person look bad ‚Äì don‚Äôt
do this maliciously ‚Äì but to avoid mistakes, air assumptions, and discuss
conclusions.

<p>To create the strategic framework, start with the company vision‚Äîwhere is it
you want to go? Then, identify the obstacles standing in the way of getting
there, and experiment around ways of tackling them. Keep doing this until the
vision is reached. A mission explains why the company exists; a vision
explains where the company is going, based on that mission.

<p>It‚Äôs easy for imposter syndrome to kick in at this point. One technique for
fighting the feeling that you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing is to simply
pretend that some expert out there knows exactly what to do, and that they‚Äôre
simply on vacation and you‚Äôre temporarily subbing in for them. It‚Äôs a great
way to remove the personal stakes and give yourself permission to fail and
learn. -Google's SWE book</p>

<p>‚ÄúAll models are wrong, but some are useful‚Äù is a famous quote often attributed

<blockquote>
<p>It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life. -Jean-Luc Picard</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A concept is a structure that is invented to give a coherent account of the
immediate consequences of actions in a complex system. Thus concepts are
rarely ends in themselves, but are means to other ends.  - Daniel Jackson's paper on concepts?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A coward dies a thousand times before his death, but the valiant taste of
death but once. It seems to me most strange that men should fear, seeing that
death, a necessary end, will come when it will come. -julius ceaser, shakespeare </p>
