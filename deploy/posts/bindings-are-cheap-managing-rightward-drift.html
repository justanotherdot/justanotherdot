          <p>How do you avoid deeply nested <code>if let</code> or <code>match</code> statements when you're first
coming to Rust? Rightward drift is a pain to decipher in any language, but the
good news is you can manage rightward drift in Rust with a few techniques and
some mental shifting. Maybe this is the code you're writing which has a lot of
if-let chaining:</p>
<pre><code>if let Some(x) = some_func() {
    // do stuff with x
    if let Some(y) = some_func2() {
        // do other stuff with y
        if let Some(z) = some_func3() {
          // and so on
        } else {
          reticulating_splines()
        }
    } else {
        engage_thrusters()
    }
} else {
    launch_the_missiles()
}
</code></pre>
<p>In Rust, everything is an expression, and every expression has a value. For
control flow, that means all branches must return values of the same type. If
you look at the code above you ought to see that whole thing as <code>()</code>, assuming
the functions in the <code>else</code> blocks above return <code>()</code>. When I look at the above
code snippet I think &quot;this code is always meant to succeed but with different
results on the types of success&quot;. This code is always mapping <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code>
to <code>()</code>, which doesn't tell the caller much besides &quot;I might have done
something.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>A <code>None</code> implies the absence of something. If we want more information for
<em>why</em> the data we want isn't there we can use the <code>Err</code> variant on <code>Result</code></strong>.
The intent with the <code>try</code> (<code>?</code>) operator is to always allow a way to express
this 'failure' back to the caller when it first happens; we should not assume we
can go ahead safely with the subsequent code and return from the current
function.</p>
<p>A style I like to recommend to people is known by some as &quot;newspaper article&quot;
style. Since Rust is an expression-oriented language we can <code>let</code>-bind to almost
anything! This means we can write our fix as:</p>
<pre><code>let x = some_func()
  .or_else(|| { launch_the_missiles(); None } )?;
let y = some_func2()
  .or_else(|| { engage_thrusters(); None } )?;
let z = some_func3()
  .or_else(|| { reticulating_splines(); None } )?;
// and so on.
</code></pre>
<p>If we wanted to only give the caller the sense that nothing bad happened,
we could wrap the whole thing in a block and discard the result (NB. the
semicolon at the end of the block):</p>
<pre><code>fn top_level() {
    fn go&lt;T&gt;() -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {
        let x = some_func()
          .or_else(|| { launch_the_missiles(); None } )?;
        let y = some_func2()
          .or_else(|| { engage_thrusters(); None } )?;
        let z = some_func3()
          .or_else(|| { reticulating_splines(); None } )?;
        // and so on.
    }
    go(); // throw away the result for the caller.
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>But this is weird</strong>. Giving callers control is at the crux of good error
handling, especially when it comes to something as powerful as errors as values!</p>
<p>What I absolutely love about the rampant <code>let</code>-bindings approach is that it
provides a lot of flexibility for modification; with <code>let</code> bindings we can
remove or modify the offending assignments exactly, rather than mangling a
rather delicately constructed expression.</p>
<p>Rust also lets us shadow variables and with its move semantics we can avoid
unexpected allocations when doing things like expressing data as it changes
throughout various steps but under the same name:</p>
<pre><code>struct Json {
  property: i64,
}

struct Error {
  SerdeError(serde::Error),
  IoError(std::fs::IoError),
}

fn update_json() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {
  let json = include_str!(&quot;../some.json&quot;);
  let json: Json = serde_json::from_str(&amp;json);
  json.property = 42;
  let json = serde_json::to_string(&amp;json);
  fs::write(&quot;../some.json&quot;, json)?;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>let</code> bindings and the <code>try</code> operator liberally and you'll make your code
easier to modify and read. If you have custom types you've written yourself you
might,</p>
<ul>
<li>one day be able to write an implementation for the <code>Try</code> trait yourself when it stabilizes (its currently experimental)</li>
<li>take a cue from <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> and write similar combinators that let you get at internal data for your type</li>
<li>merely wrap things in <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> and use the bevy of methods they expose</li>
</ul>
