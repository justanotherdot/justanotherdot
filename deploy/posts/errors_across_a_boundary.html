              <p>There is a line across our systems we shall call the boundary. On one end of the
boundary are the cosumers and on the other side are the providers. This boundary
is what we are accustomed to calling as an interface. Interfaces are the
embodiment of the dance needed to cross the boundary. The interface may have
adapters on either side whose purpose is to munge details of the internals into
this known language of communication. This way internals can continue working
without the fuss of the protocol driving their decisions.</p>
<p>Things go wrong. But when they do developers tend to clump everything up as a
single form of error. Errors are about reporting mistakes or complications. A
better name compiler writers have been using for years is 'diagnostics'; they
should help diagnose a particular problem by being part of the symptoms an
ill-behaving service might demonstrate. As such, when an infraction occurs you
want to know who is the offending party.  Are we holding it wrong or are you?</p>
<p>When you start defining clear boundaries on your errors you make it clearer what
the fix is and who should be performing the correction. This might mean the
style of diagnostics changes. A person hacking on some code is much more
accustomed to cryptic messages from a compiler than a person using a web
interface to access their bank.</p>
<p>Clearly delineate your errors and you'll know better if something is a mistake
or a matter of environment, if it is something a maintainer needs to worry about
or a blunder from usage. There are many styles to error handling but this
approach does not impact which style you end up using. You can use this whether
it is error codes, exceptions, or values.</p>
<p>Systems architecture can largely be seen as a form of organisation. Conceptual
boundaries, domain concerns, and our pursuit of pieces that compose fuel this
organisation. Despite the layer of granularity the gist is the same. Where the
lines get drawn define who or what is on each side of the fence. When things go
wrong, tell everyone which side of the fence the mistake or complicatoin came
from.</p>
