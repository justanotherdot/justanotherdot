              <p>As part of <a href="https://www.justanotherdot.com/posts/the-lowly-assert.html">The Lowly
Assert</a> series I
wanted to go over some mathematical patterns. Filling your arsenal of known
properties helps with recognizing common ways functions, systems, etc. are, and
should continue, to behave.</p>
<p>Occasionally you'll write functions that flip-flop: when you call the function
multiple times in a row, chunks seem to cancel out. Mathematics calls these
functions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)">&quot;involutive&quot;</a>. Negating a number or a boolean twice gets you back
to the original value. Involution is handy to recognize because it's a simple
assertion:</p>
<pre><code>x == f(f(x))
</code></pre>
<p>The classic property based testing example of this is the
<code>reverse(reverse(some_list))</code> you'll see in endless tutorials and getting
started guides on the subject. When you reverse a list you expect to simply flip
the contents one end to the other, but this may not be immediately applicable to
day-to-day affairs. Here's one: a function that opens a dialogue box has two
states, open and closed, and is commonly tested for involutivity; if you didn't
have the toggling action you'd see no feedback after clicking!</p>
<p>But involution doesn't have to be about functions applied exactly twice.
Rotating around a point back to an original direction can be done with various
divisions: two rotations of pi, four rotations of pi/2, and so on. Precisely,
involution requires that the application be a single function, but we can
sometimes be a bit less rigorous and claim that two or more actions that
eventually cancel out are involutive: removing and adding an item in a
collection or returning someone's money in an exchange.</p>
<p>With this we can hopefully see the application isn't on any end of the scale:
from small to big, XORing bits to whole product flows that might 'restart' the
user in a funnel. Properties like these are worth their weight in gold because
they are useful in almost any type of testing and are definitely a shining
example of The Lowly Assert.</p>
