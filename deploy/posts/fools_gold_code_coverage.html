              <p>If you are unfamiliar with code coverage, the idea is simple: you write
accompanying tests to code and a code coverage tool produces reports of lines
covered by tests and percentage of code covered to all lines of code. The hope
is that a higher coverage with tests means you'll have a correct system. Some
places even initiate quotas on required coverage per lines of new code being
introduced. &quot;If it doesn't have tests it doesn't exist&quot; is the argument for this
requirement; code without tests is potentially problematic code, but tests are
also untested chunks of code in our codebase.</p>
<p>Consider this bit of React code, (assuming jest as the test framework):</p>
<pre><code>test('Breadcrumb renders', () =&gt; {
  expect(() =&gt; {
    &lt;Breadcrumb/&gt;
  }).not.toThrow();
});
</code></pre>
<p>What is this testing exactly? Literally any other test, even one without the
<code>toThrow</code> expectation, would mark this as a failure on an exception being
thrown. This will light up code coverage though. People learn to cheat the
system, or please the metric of code coverage percentage going up, and focus
less on the guarantees the tests are providing them. <strong>This does not help us
deliver better products to end users.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/812703192437981184">Code coverage percentage is a useless
metric</a>. There is no way
to know what percentage of code written is code your end users actually care
about. You may write a continent of code, but only 0.01% of that code may
actually be hit by users. If you are using code coverage to tell you that you
have greater than 0% code coverage than you have a code organization issue or
tests are not being verified on creation. The easiest way to kick the tires is
by making a test fail to ensure it's not always passing. Tests take more effort
to create because developer's need to ensure the tests are valid and actually
checking what we want to check.</p>
<p>Here's a different approach: instrument your application to track invocations of
code paths. You can do with this tracing, structured logging, profiling replayed
traffic, etc. The technique doesn't matter, what does is the focus on what code
production users indirectly touch.</p>
<p>There are some decent descriptions on how to think about this <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-know-what-to-test">from a human
perspective</a>, and any
approach that asks developer's to take a pause to reason about their code is
remarkable in my book, but actually knowing what your users are using is the
best way to determine what is code is valuable and what is dead.</p>
<p>Detractors may argue that code that doesn't immediately show usage should not be
hastily deleted. If things are early on at your company, doing eyeball
estimation may be fair, but practicing some basic statistical understanding is
always in order for any kind of analysis. It may take time to get to a
statistically significant result and that should, more often than not, drive
your decisions. Obviously we shouldn't trust metrics in the same way people
trusted GPS's and drove into bodies of water. When it looks like something isn't
being used, but is supporting some critical error-event handling, it is probably
a good idea to leave that in.</p>
<p>To stress again, I am <strong>not</strong> saying that testing is a pointless errand. What I
am saying is that <strong>code coverage is fool's gold</strong>. Testing provides synthetic
traffic over your code that attempts to verify things work in an ideal state,
but time spent writing code and testing said code is time lost when validation
hasn't been performed on what paying customers want. There is always a
confidence level in what you ship and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-unit-tests/153565#153565">testing is a part of that confidence
level.</a></p>
<p>Production is the only place to know <a href="https://increment.com/testing/i-test-in-production/">if code
works</a> and if it is even
being used. When thinking about your organisation's appetite for risk, consider
what it means to instrument visibility into your applications, both on an
operational and analytical level.</p>
