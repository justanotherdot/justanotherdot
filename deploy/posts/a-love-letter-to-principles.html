          <p>Programmers make assertions all the time with a wide range of utilities: tests,
types, written prose, and so on. Assertions are how we establish some ideal of
the system at any particular scope. Maybe there is a requirement that all
services in an ecosystem do not rely on each-other's internal implementation
details or that exceptions should not be thrown in library code. Perhaps a team
decides that despite correctness being of the utmost importance, it doesn't give
anyone the right to be an asshole.</p>
<p>Ray Dalio <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles">wrote a whole book on the matter of
principles</a> and feels
they are at the center for decision making and iterative improvement,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior
that gets you what you want out of life. They can be applied again and again
in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My likening of principles to assertions is superficial. Assertions are, in my
mind, simply the application of principles. We <em>assert</em> that an invariant is
upheld during each iteration of a loop, that some postcondition is still met
after execution of a function, that a system is composable and modular from
applying principles sat around the locus of flexibility. In some cases these are
machine-checked, in others they rely on humans to verify. Regardless of checking
they are still present.</p>
<p>When you have autonomy in a team it is key that you take initiative to achieve
excellence. The problem with initiative is precisely an issue of what to work
on. Principles provide a 'north star' metric that enables you to say &quot;is the
error handling in this code dividing concerns between internal versus external
concerns?&quot; or possibly &quot;do people feel supported and empowered to make the
changes they need ot make across the broader company?&quot; <strong>With principles we can
scrutinize, but also work towards, some ideal. Hence our application of these
ideals is the work we undertake.</strong></p>
<p>One could easily take principles from elsewhere but that would leave us with
little to no understanding of how to form our own principles that best suit our
needs and desires. What is the trick? The process I'm about to describe is
probably not the only way to go about carving up principles but it's one that
has worked for me and others.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justanotherdot.com/posts/a_love_letter_to_feedback_loops.html">Feedback
loops</a>
are how we take risks and reflect. Experiencing this cycle for long enough means
we start noticing
<a href="https://www.justanotherdot.com/posts/a_love_letter_to_patterns.html">patterns</a>
that can take the form of principles. A principle is really just a pattern that
can describe some ideal clearly. You make failures (by way of decisions), you
learn from failures (by way of reflection), you get principles.</p>
<p>I've been thoroughly enjoying <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158601-turn-the-ship-around">Turn that Ship
Around!</a> and
one of the mentioned mechanisms towards getting a &quot;leader-leader&quot; culture is
changing the focus from avoiding errors to achieving excellence. In this same
manner I think the best principles are formed. When I talked about <a href="https://www.justanotherdot.com/posts/make_a_home.html">treating
your codebase as a home you want to
build</a>, this 'idealised
life' that a home represents is the same as these principles I've talked about
here. In that sense, from a programmer's perspective, excellence is really just
the code and the culture we wish to embody.</p>
