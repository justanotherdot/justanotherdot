          <p>Thorsten Ball had this interesting thought bubble about having a personal
reading coach:</p>
<div class="centered"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why is picking new books to read so hard?<br><br>What I need is a personal trainer, but instead of writing workout programs they tell me what to read next.<br><br>It’s based on what I read in past and what my goals are.<br><br>They also make sure enough fiction is in there, cause it‘s important.</p>&mdash; Thorsten Ball (@thorstenball) <a href="https://twitter.com/thorstenball/status/1513184857089880069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Following your own curiosity is a highly personal activity. The crux of books
such as <a href="https://visakanv.gumroad.com/l/introspect">Introspect</a> gather around
honing one's curiosity, letting it blossom, and nurturing more of it in the
world. A coach <em>could</em> slowly learn one's personal sense of curiosity, but it
will never be to the same depth that you will know yourself.</p>
<p>Coaches are sometimes hired to help create a tailored <em>diet</em>, however. I
consistently drown in content. I think I fare better than most, but I still am
enticed by the idea of someone helping me create a specific plan for my reading
to be able to glean the benefits of reading while having time and sanity for the
other things I want to do.</p>
<p>In lieu of paying someone for this imaginary role, here's an exercise doing it
with myself. What does my current reading regiment look like?</p>
<ul>
<li>mailbrew emails with updates of
<ul>
<li>twitter</li>
<li>news</li>
<li>hackernews</li>
<li>weather forecast</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>articles on the web (easily 20-70+ multiplied across a few devices)</li>
<li>books, largely technical</li>
</ul>
<p>Major changes I enacted on immediate review was:</p>
<ul>
<li>no more news updates first thing in the morning. I will get this anyways
throughout the day.</li>
<li><em>far more</em> fiction rather than being squarely focused on non-fictional
content.</li>
<li>drastically thinning down the web content.</li>
<li>less twitter, by using a fifteen minute limit as well as a stopping the
mailbrew updates</li>
</ul>
<p>A diet isn't only <em>what</em> you consume, but also adjusting the methodology of
<em>how</em> you consume. Often, with non-fiction books, there's a tendency for people
to treat them as fiction by attempting to read them linearly, but this is a bit
aimless. Being first clear about what you are after is good, but not always
possible if you are interested in a variety of topics inside of the book.</p>
<p>One technique of handling this is to continually make progressive passes on the
book in increasing detail. This is similar to how you can reading abstracts,
introductions, and conclusions with research papers. The aim here is to pick up
the things you are interested, and not waste your time sludging along with other
material you don't care as much about.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use your passion as a gauge and if you find yourself
bored, simply skip ahead. There is no shame in it.</p>
<p>If the book is massive, with lots of things you <em>are</em> interested in, a useful
trick is to abandon the book for awhile once you've learned exactly thing, or
perhaps max three things. Whatever limit you impose depends on you, but the aim
is to limit you trudging through the book, and to make actual use of it in a
limited scope of time, rather than letting a day, become a week, become a month,
etc. This is a topic I've been quite absorbed in lately, in that gains should
be brought into smaller and smaller time frames.</p>
<p>Another thing I sometimes do is to use a front, back, and middle bookmark,
forming a sort of semi-binary search of information. The point of all of these
techniques is that they are means of filtering out content that is less useful
for us, and ultimately eliminating or reducing work to find the most useful
content for us. It is rare I find a non-fiction book that I want to read front
to back.</p>
<p>The highest value reading in my diet are books. Books given me a tremendous
amount of value. Books inspire me to write, they give me deep, refined
conversations with others who have taken the time to structure their thoughts
onto page, and they let me dream. This is why a completely non-fiction diet of
books is ineffective: solving problems is not just about discovering knowledge
and patterns to cycle through, but instead exploring problems in unexpected
ways. This means having <em>many</em> non-fiction books, using the techniques above to
work through them, as well as a single fiction book, one at a time. This allows
me to let my mind relax, in the same way that I assume artists explain the
process of doing &quot;automatic drawing&quot;.</p>
