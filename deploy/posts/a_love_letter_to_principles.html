              <p>Programmers make assertions all the time with a wide range of utilities: tests,
types, written prose, and so on. We establish some ideal of the system at any
particular scope, such as a requirement that all services in an ecosystem do not
rely on the internal implementation details or perhaps that exceptions should
not be thrown in library code. They can be related to technical details, such as
the former examples, or be more cloudy, e.g. a team could declare that,
operationally, manual tasks are never run <em>and if they are</em> they are run with a
clear audit trail or perhaps a team decides that it is part of their core
principles that despite correctness being incredibly important, it doesn't give
anyone has the right to be an asshole.</p>
<p>Ray Dalio <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles">feels principles are at the center of quality decision making and
iterative improvement</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior
that gets you what you want out of life. They can be applied again and again
in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My likening of principles to assertions is superficial. Assertions are, in my
mind, simply the application of principles. We <em>assert</em> that an invariant is
upheld during each iteration of a loop, that some postcondition is still met
after execution of a function, that a system is composable and modular from
applying the principles sat around the locus of flexibility. Our application of
these ideals forms everything we set out to build from the skeleton to the
details.</p>
<p>When you have autonomy in a team it is key that you take initiative to achieve
excellence. The problem with autonomy is precisely an issue of what to do.
Principles functions as a preeminent way to can figure this out.</p>
<p>Now, how do you procure principles? One could easily take on the principles of
others but where did these principles form in the first place?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justanotherdot.com/posts/a_love_letter_to_feedback_loops.html">Feedback
loops</a>
are how we take risks, execute, and reflect, endlessly. Experiencing this cycle
enough means we start noticing
<a href="https://www.justanotherdot.com/posts/a_love_letter_to_patterns.html">patterns</a>
that can take the form of principles. You make failures, you learn from
failures, you reflect on failures, you get principles. I've been thoroughly
enjoying <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158601-turn-the-ship-around">Turn that Ship
Around!</a> and
one of the mentioned mechanisms is changing the focus from avoiding errors to
achieving excellence. In this same manner I think the best principles are
formed. When I talked about <a href="https://www.justanotherdot.com/posts/make_a_home.html">treating your codebase as a home you want to
build</a>, this 'idealised
life' that a home represents is the same as these principles I've talked about
here. So perhaps achieving excellence isn't quite the goal and instead the goal
is simply to keep chipping away at these ideals we want our code and our culture
to embody.</p>
