          <p>Tiered categorisations of knowledge and proficiency are fundamentally flawed as
they rest on the notion that all knowledge can eventually be obtained,
retained, and divvied up amongst n-many categories. Such categorisations also
ignore the fact that most skills rely on overlapping knowledge from various
domains. In this article I propose a way to evaluate subject matter in the
context of best prioritising <em>what should I learn next?</em> I’ll also offer up an
approach to evaluating others that isn’t based on ‘skill level’ (admittedly
regurgitated from Amy Cuddy).</p>
<h2>A Tagging System</h2>
<p>Instead of suggesting that knowledge from a domain of expertise can be chunked
and tagged in toto, we consider an alternative tagging system where we look at
knowledge from three types of labels and, most importantly, accept that the
fringes are fuzzy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals
<ul>
<li>There is usually a corpus of knowledge that everyone can agree upon is
pivotal to ‘being competent/dangerous’ in a particular subject matter.
These may overlap to other skills and it may be unclear <em>which</em> skills they
overlap in, but what matters is that these skills are relatively obvious in
the domain of note.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nice-to-Haves
<ul>
<li>This is the knowledge that might be good to spend a bit of time on as it
refines and builds on fundamentals to introduce more powerful techniques
and practices. This is where the only clarity is that they are definitely
not fundamentals and they are definitely not esoteric.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trivia
<ul>
<li>This is the stuff you probably don’t need to know, like that some AIX
machines have a weird bug in certain prompts where inputting uppercase
characters will cause the machine to reboot or that earlier, alternative
architectures supported 7-bit bytes. These tidbits of information
(sometimes not so miniscule!) are probably very costly to pick up and don’t
give you much in return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These tags map very much to the progression of learning a subject: when you
start learning a subject, everything is rough and unclear; you should focus on
exposing yourself to as much as knowledge as possible even if you don’t quite
understand everything. This ’5yo’ view of the world helps build the framework
wherein we can fill in further details as we step towards the nice-to-haves,
but instead of becoming an ‘expert’ by picking up trivia, we try to avoid it,
and if it were important, then it would fall back into the nice-to-haves. This
is the important caveat to learning anything in general I’m trying to make
here; mastering a subject has nothing to do with knowing absolutely everything
there is to know.</p>
<p>The practice of using these tags is simple: whenever you’re faced with a
variety of options, pick fundamentals over nice-to-haves, nice-to-haves over
trivia, and (per that last regard) try to pick more fundamentals and
nice-to-haves in a variety of subject matter than trying to pick up a
collection of specific trivia for a single subject matter.</p>
<p>I liken this to the Pareto principle, which effectively states that input
effort is usually disproportionate to output gains, or, as the common quote
goes, “20% of the effort for 80% of the output” (although it’s perfectly
feasible for the opposite situation to occur). This roughly implies that most
initial upfront work is high leverage and that driving towards ‘expertise’ may
have little return on investment. What I like about this proposal is that it
accepts the fact that knowledge categorisation is messy and that there’s
probably no one in the world that knows everything.</p>
<h2>Evaluation of Others</h2>
<p>One problem with the above proposal is that it doesn’t consider the common
usage of such tiered categorisations: evaluation of others’ sets skills. Amy
Cuddy proposes that most people are judging you on your competency after
they’ve judged you on whether or not they can trust you. I propose we try to
drop the skill-evaluation-at-moment-of-evaluation tactic and focus on
evaluating others in two primary metrics: trust and ability to advance ones
skills over any given period of time. Some people call this “hiring for the
slope rather than the Y axis”.</p>
<p>That said, I’m predominantly a software engineer and in my experience I find
the former usage of this proposal to be the one I care about the most.
Determining what’s appropriate for ourselves rather than trying to divvy people
up into boxes is a far more valuable use of engineering time, and further,
evaluating people on the merits of their enthusiasm, ability and desire to
continually learn, and their capacity to both work away and in teams is more
worth it’s weight in gold than if someone is a self-proclaimed 10x engineer
capable of cranking a lot of (read: complicated, un-maintainable, mal-scoped)
code.</p>
