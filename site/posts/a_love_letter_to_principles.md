Programmers make assertions all the time with a wide range of utilities: tests,
types, written prose, and so on. Assertions are how we establish some ideal of
the system at any particular scope. Maybe there is a requirement that all
services in an ecosystem do not rely on eachother's internal implementation
details or that exceptions should not be thrown in library code. Perhaps
a team decides that despite correctness being of the utmost important, it
doesn't give anyone the right to be an asshole.

Ray Dalio [wrote a whole book on the
matter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles) and feels they
are at the center for decision making and iterative improvement,

> in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.

My likening of principles to assertions is superficial. Assertions are, in my
mind, simply the application of principles. We _assert_ that an invariant is
upheld during each iteration of a loop, that some postcondition is still met
after execution of a function, that a system is composable and modular from
applying principles sat around the locus of flexibility.

When you have autonomy in a team it is key that you take initiative to achieve
excellence. The problem with autonomy is precisely a constant issue of what to
work on. Principles provide a 'north star' metric that enables you to say "is
the error handling in this code dividing concerns between external versus
external errors?" or possibly "is our incident report process shaming people it
comes into contact with?" **With principles we can scrutinize, but also work
towards, some ideal. Hence our application of these ideals is the work we
undertake.**

One could easily take principles from elsewhere but that would leave us with
little to no understanding of how to form our own principles that best suit our
needs and desires. What is the trick? The process I'm about to describe is
probably not the only way to go about carving up principles but it's one that
has worked for me and others:

[Feedback
loops](https://www.justanotherdot.com/posts/a_love_letter_to_feedback_loops.html)
are how we take risks and reflect. Experiencing this cycle for long enough means
we start noticing
[patterns](https://www.justanotherdot.com/posts/a_love_letter_to_patterns.html)
that can take the form of principles. A principle is really just a pattern that
can describe some ideal clearly. You make failures (decision), you learn from
failures (reflection), you get principles.

I've been thoroughly enjoying [Turn that Ship
Around!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158601-turn-the-ship-around) and
one of the mentioned mechanisms is changing the focus from avoiding errors to
achieving excellence. In this same manner I think the best principles are
formed. When I talked about [treating your codebase as a home you want to
build](https://www.justanotherdot.com/posts/make_a_home.html), this 'idealised
life' that a home represents is the same as these principles I've talked about
here. In that sense, excellence is really just the code and the culture we wish
to embody.
