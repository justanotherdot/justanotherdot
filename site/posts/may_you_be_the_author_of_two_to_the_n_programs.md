Earlier in the year I got burnt out from work. Because I also had other
stressors happening in my life, I decided I would go seek medical attention.
Being diagnosed with OCD as part of these sessions was paradoxically both
shocking and not much of a surprise.

I have been working through particular processes for accepting mess. In my line
of work having a pedantic attitude towards what I do has helped me excel. It has
also held me back in a number of ways. **If you can't seem to defer some
decisions as you hack on a solution, a striving for perfection is probably
holding you back.**

How do you get around this? Art & Fear's primary tenants are twofold:

* Don't compare your processes or personal history of accomplishments to others
* Be prolific

An analogy is given in the book of a pottery teacher who divides his class into
two: one half will be judged by the quantity of pottery they produce, the other
will be judged by the quality. The story goes that the prolific pottery pupils
(couldn't resist the alliteration) produce far better work than the
qualitatively focused pupils as they are continuously practicing whereas the
qualatatively focuesd group spent far too much time thinking.

Thought is important, but what is even more important is making mistakes and
learning from them. I think there is something else here at play, too; accepting
mess.

How does one go about accepting more mess in their programming?

* Take projects from start to finish in some allotted time
* When the project is done, sit with your discomfort about it. Don't try to
  change subjects, move onto new things, fix what's there, simply sit with the
  discomfort and try to track how you feel. With time, and a lot of these
  sessions, you'll see that there isn't much to cause you great harm if you
  have a bit of mess. In fact, you will probably feel a lot better that you
  are completing things!

"but I work in a feature factory!" is a fair complaint I hear a lot. If you work
in any kind of dysfunctional workplace, though, you won't be given the chance to
revisit things, and not having that capacity means you need to move on, as well
as dealing with the immediate discomfort you (may) experience.
