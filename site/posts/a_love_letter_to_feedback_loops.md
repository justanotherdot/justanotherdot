Feedback loops are everywhere and they're awesome. Almost every self-help or
productivity-oriented book has some variant of a feedback loop. In essence,
whenever there is some system with inputs, outputs, and some readjustment based
on the outputs of the system, that's a feedback loop. The analysis of the output
'feeds back' to the input and the system is now different, and hopefully better,
because of it.

what about refinement of the feedback loops themselves? Truly productive people
not only recognise feedback loops but relentlessly modify them so they reach
their full potential. We tend to call this act of refinement as making the
feedback loop 'tighter', although that might not mean making the delay between
some analysis and the adjustment shorter, _per se_.

For example, you might code and run something like `cargo watch`, `jest`,
[`entr`](http://entrproject.org/), et. al. to avoid having to switch to your
terminal, find the test command, and hit enter. Dropping those steps makes the
loop 'tighter' and means you get feedback (the state of the tests) far sooner
(and automatically).

Or perhaps you are a car manufacturer who gets reports from the dealerships
about sales to help you better gauge how many to make next. If you react too
quickly you might wind up producing a surplus right before a lull in the market.
[Thinking in Systems: A
Primer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems)
discusses this same case.

Refining a feedback loop is really a matter of finding the sweet spot where it
delivers the most value.

If you're mathematically inclined or curious, there is [control
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) for designing feedback
loops in mechanical and dynamical systems. This [AWS
re:invent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8xLxNje30M) talk gives a good
practical application of the control theory to software with respect to the
creation of S3.

When it comes to feedback loops for humans, we need to take risks to make
failures to learn. We learn more from our failures than our successes, but we
can't make huge failures all the time. Ray Dalio's
[Principles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles) describes
the process as reaching for goals (taking risk), experiencing failure
(inevitably), learning from the failures (growth), and then upping the audacity
of said goals. This is pretty cool because it means it's not only OK to
experience failure but it's crucial to achieve what we truly want in life. The
sweet spot is experiencing enough failure so as to allow one to come back with
big dreams.

bold risks! You can't think through everything. Sometimes you'll need to tinker,
make mistakes, refine, and take bolder risks next time!
