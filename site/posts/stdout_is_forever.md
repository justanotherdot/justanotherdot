Debuggers are worth their weight in gold but stdout is the diamond in the rough.
Many things such as REPLs can help pinpoint problems, such as automatic tracing,
stacktraces, and so on. However, they all wind up being about two things: **poking**
and **prodding**.

## A useful macro or two

Rust has the `dbg!` macro and I love it. It's short enough to type and it shows
you what file you are in, line you are on, and how the code looks plus its
value after evaluation. e.g. `dbg!(dbg!(12) == dbg!(1 + 11))` will print

```
[src/main.rs:2] 12 = 12
[src/main.rs:2] 1 + 11 = 12
[src/main.rs:2] dbg!(12) == dbg!(1 + 11) = true
```

Two important quirks with this are,

1. No arguments passed means you just get the file and line number
2. The code still behaves the way it used to except now you have tracing

This gives us just enough information to be lethal. This is possible because
this expands at compile time and can be replicated in other languages that have
macro support. This is a source transformation and we can't easily use a
function because our line number will always be the line number of the function,
not the calling site. As such, one option is to write it as some repeated action
in your editor of choice. Consider the following go code,

```
func AddOne(x Int) Int {
  return x + 1
}
```

and you want to lay down some tracing so you highlight the `x + 1` and hit a
keyboard shortcut which transforms the code into the following,

```
func AddOne(x Int) Int {
  fmt.Printf("[src/main.go:8] x + 1: %#v", x + 1)
  return x + 1
}
```

We could have also used the
[`runtime.Caller`](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#Caller) function to get
filename and line number but we can get that spliced in via our editor to avoid
an import. If you are curious what the `runtime.Caller` code looks like here it
is (and, yes, I'm ignoring error handling here since this is intentionally
throwaway code):

```
func AddOne(x Int) Int {
	_, file, line, _ := runtime.Caller(0)
	fmt.Printf("[%v:%v] x + 1: %#v\n", file, line, x+1)
  return x + 1
}
```

The advantage with the above is now we can take our print lines and move them
around at will and we won't have to tweak the filename/lineno combo.

## Poking

Sometimes the fastest way to get at a problem is by writing test cases that flex
assertions about the functionality in question. Other times that's not so fast
because the logic might rely on other systems, e.g. integration tests. In those
cases, if you have stacktrace support you might find it useful to panic/throw if
particular assertions aren't met. When that fails you are probably facing some
code you interface with that is covering up exceptions or panics, say a piece of
library code that takes your code as a callback. When this happens you could try
stubbing in your own forked version of the code (scripting languages tend to
make this easy) or you could turn to tracing. How it works is we iteratively
apply print statements like this

```
fn foo() {
  dbg!() # beginning
  <snip>
  dbg!() # middle
  <snip>
  dbg!() # end
}
```

With `dbg!` this is really easy because I don't have to think
about what to pass to the printing function since `dbg!()` simply
emits the filename and line number. In languages that may not have this I've
done `printf(X)` where X = "A", "B", "C", and so on.

With this format in place you can use binary search to figure out where you need
to apply more printing statements on each subsequent run. If, however, your
tests or program take a long while to run it can pay to do upfront work but
perhaps limiting yourself to an arbitrary depth to prevent spending too long on
tracing that won't help you.

## Prodding

You can load your [core
dumps](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/04/28/debugging-a-segfault-on-linux/) into
`gdb` and explore the call stack after a segfault, sure, but hopefully this
article has shown that stdout gives you equal debugging functionality since we
already have access to executing the program and manipulating its source. We can
print assertions to see if they hold up or mess around with alternative
solutions that may work if the problem is clear. Stdout isn't always the fastest
but it's _lightweight_ which makes it invaluable as it can circumvent a lot of
preparatory work. You can pair this approach into a feedback loop, too, to
reduce duplicated work such as running the tests or program over and over again.
In a future article I'll discuss ways to do this in a range of languages and
environments but at least we've set the tone for some thinking about how to best
spit out information while you hack.
