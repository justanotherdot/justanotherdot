  Reading review for 2021
---

Instead of focusing on the entirety or majority of books I’ve read this year, I
wanted to focus, instead, on the books that made a mark on me in some way or
another, and the key takeaways for each book.

Summaries for books vary drastically. Good writing is an interplay between
compression of information on the part of the author as well as compression of
information on the part of the reader. To put it another way, a good author
engages with an audience, and that engagement requires a magical sense of
economy with words.

All the takeaways here are from memory. I’ve explicitly not gone back to dig up
quotes or reread anything. I think the impressionism of this approach may be
more useful to you, the reader of this article, as it shows my reflections and
digestions of the work, rather than giving you a digestion of the book in its
raw, unaltered form.

## Write Useful Books

This was likely the best book I read all year. It had the most tangible
information for writing I’ve yet to encounter. It practices what it preaches,
and the bulk of useful information is at the front, while the rest of the book
fills out information without being too lengthy. Rob’s other books, such as The
Mom Test, are equally as effective at delivering value for the topics they
address.

## A Monk’s to a Clean House and Clean Mind

How you treat objects translates to how you treat others. There is a great deal
of practice, habit, and care in each of the common tasks in this book. Little
notes such as opening windows or clean your face when you first get up drive the
essence of cleanliness which helps, per the author’s sentiment, hone the mind in
a way similar to meditation.

## Goodbye, Things

Living minimally doesn’t have to be reductionist for the sake of being
reductionist. Given there is an upper threshold to the things we can reasonably
care about, a la Marie Kondo’s “spark joy” enthusiasm, we can offload the
storage of things onto other places, such as accepting that stores will have the
things we need when we need them or search engines the results rather than us
having to hoard bookmarks, as well as stripping back to the things that matter
to us in the most direct forms as possible, such as giving away whole lots of
possessions or throwing things away without worrying about the lost value.

## Nation

A young indigenous boy is left out of a freak accident that causes his whole
island to be killed off. A shipwrecked girl winds up on the same island. The two
meet and eventually work together to rebuild the island as other stranded
individuals seek refuge. Classic Pratchett, but with the silliness knob turned
down drastically.

## Tao Te Ching, Le Guin translation

I’ve lost count of how many translations of the tao te ching I’ve read over the
year. Some have been quite dry, unintelligible, others a bit *too* imaginative.
This version has interesting twists and turns around power dynamics with a
modern light. I’ll break my promise about finding quotes and will share my
favorite section, although favorites always ebb and flow on subsequent readings.

> Raw silk and uncut wood

> Stop being holy, forget being prudent,
> it’ll be a hundred times better for everyone.
> Stop being altruistic, forget being righteous,
> people will remember what family feeling is.
> Stop planning, forget making a profit,
> there won’t be any robbers.

> But even these three rules
> needn’t be followed; what works reliably
> is to know the raw silk,
> hold the uncut wood.
> Need little,
> want less.
> Forget the rules.
> Be untroubled.

## A Wizard of Earthsea (first four books)

Another from Ursula K. Le Guin, the story of a sorcerer named Ged. It is a fun
read in light of Rust’s focus on ownership around names and the emphasis of
names being the means of power over the world; this isn’t a new thought in
fantasy fiction, as Gandalf mentions how “the I belong to the name” in the Lord
of The Rings and others, as well as the Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs talking about the notion that names allow a sorcerer/wizard power of
the spirits.

An interesting note from Le Guin I read this year had to do with her regretting
that Ged was chosen to be a man. There is a surprising lack of female
characters. Nonetheless, Ged’s exploration into the rift of the world where
names may not apply is an interesting existential investigation on the manner of
how we struggle with meaning and uncertainty, but not something that means all
hope is lost to the chaos lurking underneath. As Pema Chödrön would say,
“welcome chaos with a cup of tea.”

## Klara and the Sun

An artificial friend is chosen by a sickly child to accompany her at home in a
world where children are regularly genetically enhanced and attend school
remotely. Klara is convinced that the sun is a living entity that nourishes her,
and views pollutants as “his” (the sun’s) enemy. Despite being a material good
purchased for “socialisation” in the place of a child’s life, there is no
denying that Klara has had her own experiences, perceptions, and a reflections
after she is finally scrapped in a yard with other artificial friends.

## Thinking Physics

It doesn’t teach you physics, but it can teach you aspects and characteristics
of physics through a question and answer styled puzzle book. The book poses a
problem, has you think about it and come up with an answer (multiple choice),
and then read the solution. It builds up an understanding over time that helps
drive other solutions, but it does lack a reflective, conversational tone that I
find better helps instill the ideas. That said, I do think it is a style of
important deliberate practice that is often missed in many other books, or
relegated to oft ignored “exercise” sections.

## The Practice

I can see how people hate this book. At it’s core it is an assemblage of various
commentary around consistent practice of *anything* you are involved in doing.
The points about receding into the shadows as hiding, which is unfair to others,
and how a fear of sharing comes from lack of identification with an abundance
mindset resonated particularly well. I find books like this good because they
are fractal in that you can open the book wherever you please and find something
useful.

## 4000 Weeks and The Practice Of Not Thinking

I mention both of these books in tandem because some of thoughts overlap.

In 4000 weeks, we are confronted with a discussion around the point that we will
inevitably need to make hard, uncomfortable choices around what we really want
to do; that in the end, we will not be able to do everything we set out to do,
no matter what productivity hacks we employ. This ties into something I’ve been
thinking about as of late, which is that we tend to de-emphasize the importance
of estimations and think less and less about targets or deadlines for ourselves
with the assumption that we will simply live forever, even though we may
consciously be quite well aware of the counter being true. In this sense, we
turn some things into games. Wondering how fast you can summarise an article or
a book? How quickly can you finish one piece of the puzzle of your work or
hobby?

I want to give a head tilt to Seth Godin’s The Dip here, where the notion of
knowing when to quit or not is the main treatise of the book. It is generally
applied to whole sets of skills, but I think this same sense can be equally
applied to anything we do; is it really worth me summarising this article in a
short period of time? Is this project really _the_ thing I want to be doing
right now?

In The Practice of Not Thinking, the author Ryonuske Koike explores the notions
of meditation around the fundamental premise that, practically, being attached
to our thoughts is an issue all of itself. If we can constrain our focus to
singular points rather than pretending we can multitask, then we can feel more
connected with the world and ourselves. If we can reduce work in progress, we
not only are making the hard choices in face of the facts, but we are also
getting better at focusing itself.

The big thing here for others is probably handling information. The crux of this
is that we tend to drown ourselves with information without considering how we
can better cut through it. This also means being ruthless in how you approach
any sort of content, in any sort of medium. Calling a book done doesn’t have to
be because you read every imaginable word. It can be “done” for you because
you’ve cleared through the chapters or subsections that matter most to you. In
the same sense, work can be “done” given what you’ve built up so far in an
iterative or incremental way. In short, I like a lot of this thinking because I
really like the idea of incremental computation, and I think that the notion of
incremental computation doesn’t stop at just how we design systems or programs.

## The Dawn of Everything

I haven’t quite finished this one yet, but the premise of the book is a great
one; indigenous people have been marginalised unnecessarily despite sparking the
enlightment period itself with their insights, imagination, and ability to
consider complex social structures where individuals can act as autonomous
authorities in the context of a larger collective. This last point is
interesting to me; I and others I’ve seen often act in a constrained way,
fearing the repercussions of the larger group, and while this is valid in
itself, it also means individuals don’t act as boldly or as outwardly as they
_could_ while still being OK according to social norms. I think part of the
restraint may be because social norms _aren’t_ as loose, hence a new wave of
“don’t give a fuck” attitudes floating around. To quote an amazing line from
Arvid Kahl’s The Embedded Entrepreneur, “embrace fear, listen to it, invite it
in, but ultimately, ignore it.” To paraphrase, while it’s good to contemplate
your fears, they should not be the thing that guides who you are as a person
through being the core of your actions.
