  Swaths of people are shifting into working from home, otherwise acronymized as
  "wfh", and for some it's a drastic shift. For those with kids, the reduce
  productivity will be a change even for those that _are_ used to working from
  home. I have a fair amount of experience working from home and I thought I'd
  share some thoughts from my experience of key things that have helped keep me
  productive but also, more importantly, sane. Afterall, long periods of time kept
  locked up inside can easily drive one to cabin fever; how do all the
  introverts and remote workers keep from space madness?

Welcome. You are now working from home. You have a computer, a brain, and way to
link the two, and this is (for purposes of simplifying this article) largely
what you need to get your job done.

Parts of what I'm to recommend are obviously peppered with caveats due to the
nature of why people are coming in droves to the practice of working remotely.
Take what I say with a grain of salt.

_NB. I started writing this on a Sunday and became aware of Alice Goldfuss'
[fantastic article](https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/work-in-the-time-of-corona/)
on the same subject the Monday wafter. It is far more thorough and I really
recommend it._

* Wear your work clothes. This is going to set of the "I'm wearing work cloths,
  I'm going to work" cells firing. Resist the urge to wear the same clothes
  you wore last night post shower and relaxation. There's a few points here that
  are about separation

* Get outside. If you have a morning routine, say with tea or coffee, it can help
  to simply exit your house for a brief period of time in the morning.
  Getting some time outside the confines of the
  walls of your home may seem inconsequential but I've found it to have a
  profound impact on my psyche. Lots of these points may seem like "well of
  course!" but the reality is that working from home tends to get you into
  tunnel vision about work.

* Dedicate space to where you work if you can. Productivity can dwindle, and
  your ability to relax, if you mix and match places for use of work and
  leisure. If you don't have the space to dedicate as an office you can always
  pick strategic places in your house that are more for business than they are
  for recreation. For example, it might be cool to work at the dining table or
  the kitchen island but not in bed and on the couch.

* Do a bit of exercise. Doing a small run or bike around the block, some yoga at
  home, or doing pushups, situps, and jumping jacks throughout your day in small
  spurts can add up. Lack of exercise can lead to a reduction in energy and
  alertness but you don't need to be doing really heavy exercise to get back
  into the habit.

* Do a bit of stretching at regular intervals. I make this a separate point
  because if you work at a computer like me, it's vital to remember to get up
  and move around constantly _and_ stretch out all the muscles attached your
  hands are up in your back, neck, and so on. I also own a foam roller and
  massage ball for my back and neck that I use for about ten minutes at the end
  of each day.

* If you work in a high-pace work environment, having lunch at the ready so you
  don't have to cook it really helps reduce stress. Ditto breakfast and dinner
  although, in another point we'll cover, hours of work can sort of distort a
  bit.

* Depending on what you can do, if you do anything with a deep work effort, be
  free with how you organize your day during the "deep work" period. There might
  be the period of time where everyone catches up, perhaps with a standup or
  quick chat, but the idea is that you should feel a bit more free to, say, read
  a bit for fifteen minutes or take a bike ride. This is important because it breaks up
  your day and time you reclaim from the commute shouldn't all be poured into
  work. You need to structure the demarcation of you-time and work-time
  responsibly because things like getting on the train won't be present.

* If you are a social person, it can help to have things like podcasts and audio
  books at the ready so you can get an influx of other humans talking into your
  daily psyche diet. I call this the morning-television effect. When people put
  on morning television it is more to create the presence of people than the
  content they broadcast. It can pay to have a little bit of human communication
  on a quick ten to fifteen minute call per day either for work or with a
  friend, too.

* In some ways we are basically like plants in that we need water, oxygen, and
  light. Getting plenty of these in some form or another really improves quality
  of life while working from home. This is a bit more than the "get out of the
  house" point because it can be done without leaving the home, although getting
  out of the house also makes you feel a bit "free" from the confines of your
  home as well. Physiological needs can be the first place to try to supplement
  and repair when things are feeling funky at home.

* When you feel flustered, shut off the computer for a bit.
  I know not everyone can do this as some people's jobs, say in software
  operations, need to be present for most of their clocked time when on duty. If
  you do have the option, it is powerful to push your laptop away and go
  someplace with just your journal. Once there, try to de-stress a bit and
  forget work. Once your head is a bit clear, focus on whatever problem you are
  dealing with on paper first. Being indoors is claustrophic. Being indoors
  _inside the mental space of a computer_ is doubly so.

A majority of these boil down to a couple of heuristics:

1. Focus on your physiological needs when things seem off as a first step
2. Ensure you have routines and structure in place to keep your mind focused
3. Be flexible with your expectations on yourself, your experience, and you
   work, particularly with respect to your hours and what you spend time on

As I write this it's a stressful period. Go easy on yourself and those around
you while everyone adjusts. Hopefully some points here help ease the adjustment.
