This year came up at roughly sixty books "consumed". I say "consumed" because I
decided to give audio books a go. So while I would normally read about thirty
books, I've managed to double that amount by listening to things while I work.

Things of note:

* It may seem obvious (or not?) that there is a tremendous amount of noise out
  there but I'd like to specify that **there is _a lot_ of fluff out there in
  what we choose and are asked to read**.

    * The best books were too complex and deep to truly grok in a single pass,
      but still lucid enough to catch on core points in that first pass. I call
      this quality "replayability".

    * Worst books were shallow and forgettable.

    * Overcoming the discomfort of skimming and skipping through books has had a
      remarkable impact on helping me tackle material I'm requested to ingest.

    * I found a lot of value in taking notes during or after reading. I heard
      once that spending a brief period (specifically thirty seconds, but that
      feels _too_ short) of time to summarize recently received information, no
      matter how complex.

* When I found a book truly worth its weight, I would buy a physical copy to
  review sections.

* Of notable mention are Naval Ravikant's tweet storm and podcasts on [How to Get
  Rich (without getting lucky)](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936?lang=en).

* Two particularly inspiring non-technical blog posts were [Speed
  Matters](https://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters) and [More People Should
  Write](https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write). I also felt a
  kinship for Alexis King's process described in [Parse, Don't
  Validate.](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/).

* I found it useful to read contrarian takes on subjects so that I'm not stuck
  in my own bubble of thought.

Onto some short blurbs on what I've read. These are no replacements for properly
reading the texts, but they may give you an idea of some core concepts and
provide some interest for diving into some.

People's History of Computing In The United States

  A fabulous recount about the history of time sharing computing systems in the
  united states. I found the exploration of the social and economic contexts of
  how these large-scale systems rose up fascinating. Easily goes in the
  collection of great narrative historical stories of computing along with Soul
  of a New Machine.

Unix: A History and Memoire

  For the *nix fans out there this is a wonderful telling of the people involved
  in the makings of Unix at Bell Labs. Brian Kernighan has written several books
  that are always fun to get through: The Awk Programming Language, The C
  Programming Language, The Go Programming Language, and so on. Learning that
  Ken Thompson wrote the prototype of what would become Unix in three weeks
  absolutely blew my mind.

The Rational Optimist

  The thesis of this book is that although things seem bleak in our current
  state of human affairs, especially in regards to the knock-on effects of
  capitalism, the degradation of the environment, and rampant political
  fracturing, we are actually in a far better place than we were before now.
  Ridley proposes that bartering is what makes us distinct from other animals
  and that our ability to form markets and labour has allowed us to accelerate
  advancement of our day-to-day lives.

Influence

  There's about six-ish things that Caildini focuses on as pillars of influence
  on humans. By taking various roles and exploring each concept in relation to
  the presumed job, Caildini explores things like scarcity, consistency,
  attractiveness, providing reasons to requests, etc. Caldaini's original
  framing of the book was to help provide tips so people could better understand
  how to combat the effects of influence but it seems like it has become a
  reference as a means of understanding a subset of persuasion on others.

God's Debris - Scott Adams

  Thought experiment where a parcel carrier has a series of discussions with
  God. Deep (and quick) enough for a read.

Platform

  Johnson's argument is that you are only truly an expert in a field if you hold
  a reputation for it. A reputation is only built by putting work into gaining
  an audience (platform). She outlines several ideas and approaches for doing
  this digitally.

Beyond Religion

  The Dalai Lama examines various topics of life from a consciously secular
  standpoint.

The Courage To Be Disliked

  A discourse about Adlerian psychology expressed as a young-man/old-man
  dialogue which is trite. I found the various concepts (especially that of
  people inventing their dramas) to be particularly intriguing. In the story
  they explore the concept that other people have desires that they expect of us
  but we ought to ignore them and instead focus on our freedom to react to
  events however we truly prefer.

The Purple Cow

  Remarkable things sell. If you don't have a remarkable thing, you ought to
  find one to sell. If you have a remarkable thing, don't pretend the effect
  will last forever.

To Sell Is Human

  No matter your career selling is a part of it. You must convince people with
  resources to part with them, usually in exchange for something else. This
  thesis is not dissimilar from The Rational Optimist.

No-Drama Discipline

  Each time when things get heated between parent and child is actually an
  opportunity to explain and teach. I sometimes find parenting books to be
  helpful for peer-to-peer social interactions but this is a bit more intimate
  and top-down so I wouldn't recommend using the same approach outside a
  parent-child circumstances.

The Autobiography of Gucci Mane

  This was highly ranked in recommendations for marketing but I'm not sure why.
  Gucci Mane explains his upbringing, his entry into rap, the continual
  inclusion of criminal activity and drugs (especially 'lean'), all while
  achieving stellar success. The book finishes with him being fully incarcerated
  and going through a period of withdrawal where he realizes he wants to
  properly abandon drugs and turn his life around.

Born Standing Up

  Incredible autobiography about Steve Martin's adventure through standup and
  eventual explosion of fame (and his disgust of it thanks to his
  dissatisfaction of the isolation it caused). It's interesting to note his
  exploration of his standup style and career as a serious business endeavour
  rather than coming off as part of his 'art'.

Hacking Growth

  A cut-and-dry prescription approach to "growth hacking" and the book that
  claims to have been written by those who have started the movement although
  business intelligence is definitely far older than slapping a label on
  analysing metrics for everything you can get your hands on. This book was too
  prescriptive for me and I wound up finding it a chore to get through. Growth
  hacking books often have a tendency of sounding like all the same argument:
  "measure everything you can get your hands on", although I would argue having
  a couple of key metrics is a far better use of time.

The Mom Test

  People will lie to you to feel good about themselves. Don't let this sort of
  'mom'-styled sentiments impede on the true stuff you want: how people have
  actually had problems in the past and how your new things can help those
  problems. Don't focus on stuff in the future, prospective ideas are always
  fanciful but pain points people have suffered through are rooted in fact and
  will definitely lead people to your product as a (potential) panacea of their
  woes.

This is Marketing

  Marketing is actually good for us. Marketing directs us to products that
  change our lives for the (arguably) better position and helps normalize this
  behaviour.

Extreme Ownership

  A long books with many belabored combat stories effectively stating that if
  you have direct reports and they fail, it's always back on you to teach them
  (unless they truly are inept).

Never Split the Difference

  Many fantastic tidbits of negotiation techniques. Some of these are drawn from
  other sources but it's how Voss correlates the concepts to practical usage I
  found particularly helpful. There is a section of salary negotiation I think
  ought to be valuable to a broad range of people in the job market.

Essentialism

  Lots of great little points on the "less is more" rhetoric. I keep being
  reminded of the reality that "small wins" are energy-inducing and help create
  true progress on a project.

Anything You Want

  This has got tons of great bits from the guy who built CDBaby
  (unintentionally) and eventually sold the company at $12m. However, his
  success was forged by by attempting to fail early on, he claims.

The Personal MBA

  A chronicle of different ways to run businesses or investments as well as a
  (surprisingly) thorough analysis of how systems work so that the viewpoint of
  business development is taken as system development, instead of the
  traditionally goal-oriented approach. Brownie points for me as it covers
  Gall's Law in one section.

Principles

  Divided into two sections, principles discusses life and work principles (the
  latter being far larger but imo the former being the most applicable for the
  general public). You can watch and read most of his material without buying
  his book online as his emphasis isn't making money off the book but sharing
  his knowledge (or so he claims). I've found it to be a fantastic trove of
  knowledge that seems to come up in several other books I've read.

Black Swan

  I did not know about Nassim Taleb until this year when a mentor of mine
  brought him up. I was skeptical at first but Ray Dalio's idea of "Radical
  Open Mindedness" made me push through and it's been fantastic. Taleb, a former
  quant, digs deep into why any sort of predictive analysis we think is
  rock-solid is usually a scam and that things people think are impossible
  becuase they are extremely improbably are actually "black swans" that have a
  high likelihood of causing ruin if we don't put things into place to safeguard
  ourselves against them.

The Culture Code

  People are productive when they feel safe. They are more creative and
  innovative. This is fundamentally maslows hierarchy of needs but it's a great
  read after having been in a few organisations where culture was a, well,
  lacking. Vulnerability is key to forming trust, and trust builds the most
  productive teams.

Rework

  Your work doesn't control you. You ought to be experiencing JOMO (joy of
  missing out) vs FOMO (fear of missing out). A well-rested and clear-headed
  employee stays longer at a company and is wildly more productive than the
  run-down equivalent.

Alibaba

  A rather bland telling of Jack Ma's history. The parts of how Jack's interest
  in translation work and willingness to do pretty much anything as a business
  until Alibaba came to fruition (due to Jack's early interest in the internet
  and being at the right place at the right time, his first business being a
  translation company) is met with some bittersweetness upon hearing that the
  government now owns the very thing he fought so hard to build up and hold
  onto.

Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman

  Feynman is a mixed bag. He is quick witted and definitely smart but is also a
  creep. His autobiography paints a picture of a happy-go-lucky, curious-minded,
  exploration-driven individual who loves to prank and be a smart alec and isn't
  shy to discuss his visitations to strip clubs where he would draw the
  strippers and work on physics problems. That said, it is interesting to look
  at how Feynman is always deducing from other facts or principles which you can
  see in the way the text is written.

No Hard Feelings

  An interesting exploration into how to accept that emotions are always apart
  of our lives, including at work, and how to use that knowledge to best effect.
  Also a good reminder that our work is not everything.

When Things Fall Apart

  A discussion from a buddhist monk about how chaos is inevitable and how we
  must, no matter how stable we think life is, continually invite "chaos in with
  a cup of tea" if we are truly to handle what life has to throw at us.

Turn the Ship Around

  A naval captain (and now admiral?) tells how he managed to change from a
  top-down organisational structure into something with a bit more autonomy
  amongst all the ranks and clearly exposits each technique used througought the
  book. Feelings of ownership make us more productive around things and in
  top-down organisations there's usually a fear that if ownership is allowed, it
  will cause all sorts of mayhem.

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck

  What a terrible book. Espousings of general philosophical and psychological
  ideas from an author who sounds like he took first-year courses on the subject
  and is just _dying_ to tell you about all the details he's learned.

Ultralearning

  An interesting exploration into a form of learning where progress and speed
  (and hence repetition) are the focus. Compressing learning into short bursts
  at a time to accelerated levels. I have mixed feelings about this book after
  having come out of therapy this last year because while I am very much into
  this processes in this book I felt not enough emphasis was placed on
  counterpointing the pushing process with something relaxing. In the end
  learning a lot is worthwhile but I think being a human is far more valuable.

Inner Engineering

  I didn't know about Sadghuru until I saw a video series on YouTube with some
  of his clips. Inner engineering has some intriguing nuggets of knowledge, such
  as reminding ourselves of our mortality that feeds into how we prioritise our
  actions. His thoughts on responsibility are great, too: it's not about
  "taking" or being "given" responsibility, but responsibility itself is an act
  of mindfulness or consciousness. In this case responsibility is our ability to
  respond (a common thread across several books is how its in our capacity to
  respond to the world rather than reacting in off-the-cuff manners. Meditation
  has helped me with this a lot).

Atomic Habits

  Although nothing _new_ is prescribed here, I applaud James Clear with
  compiling a simple compendium of core concepts that fuel habit formation. All
  the worksheets and similar activities I easily ignored but the four points are
  well worth an extra bit of reading to cement the ideas.

Nonviolent Communication

  This one is "a classic" in that it is commonly referenced as being a big part
  of negotiation and interpersonal relationships. Rosenfield's foundations are
  that failure to recognise needs is the crux of interpersonal conflict failure.

Art and Fear

  This one is great as it applies to areas way outside of simply creating
  artworks. I found this incredibly useful in terms of recognising that quantity
  is much more valuable for the effort of learning (experimentation) than is
  focusing on quality upfront.

Why we Sleep

  Most of us know sleep deprivation is problematic but this book goes deeper in
  how debilitating it can truly be, as well as how little sleep deprivation is
  required before achieving these effects.

Range

  Being an expert usually is less effective than being a jack of all trades.
  Why? Because experts go down deep holes that start to lose innovation as they
  have less cross-disciplinary skills or knowledge to create the connections
  necessary.

Daring Greatly

  Being courageous means sharing. We tend to think its the other way; that
  sharing _takes_ courage, but in reality if you share. This little fact has
  been incredibly useful this year as a knowledge point: just go for it and
  share facts (as longas you aren't sharing for the sake of manipulating others,
  what Brown cals "oversharing").

How to Fail at almost everything and still win big

  Systems over goals. Energy instead of passion. A varied collection of ideas
  and memoirs of how Scott Adams built various aspects of his career.

It's a numberful world

  Fun exploration in various mathematical concepts from Eddie Woo.

Euler's gem

  An exploration of Euler's formula in great detail and history.

Infinite powers

  Absolutely wonderful exploration of the history and internals of calculus.
  Strogatz is the author of Sync, Non-linear Dynamics and Chaos, The Joy of X,
  and others. His ability to talk about systems

101 things I learned from (urban planning | architecture | advertising |
engineering | law ) school

  I have several of these '101 things' books. They are a breeze to get through
  (some of the points are just quotes, or usually short blurbs, less than two,
  on average about one, paragraphs each) and often about 2-4% of those points
  are absolute gold. One that is off the top of my head from recently finishing
  the advertising version of the series is the notion that you should emphasis
  getting your message across as many people as possible if it applies to a
  broad reach (say, toilet paper) while a specific niche demographic is best hit
  with higher frequency.

ogilvy on advertising

  Dated and sort of part biography and random ranting. I'm not sure how relevant
  this book is to today's market. It may have made sense back in the day as
  insight into the view of how one of the largest tyrants of the advertising
  industry lead the competition, but today it doesn't provide much insight.

realm of racket

  If you've ever read "Land of Lisp" this is mostly a reboot of that series
  except set in a different environment (you're trapped in a evil genius' lair)
  and everything is in racket instead of common lisp.

functoinally-light javascript

  With an intro from Brian Lonsdorf of ["Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate
  Guide to Functional Programming
  Guide"](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/) fame, the
  book is a relative guide through several libraries and their related concepts.
  Teaching something like functional programming in a language outside of lisp
  or haskell/ocaml/etc. is a tad hard.

game engine blackbook wolf 3d and doom

  These are fabulous books and if you have any nostalgia for them whatsoever and
  you program, you should pick them up. They cover a portion of history of
  product development, hardware, and a good analysis of the internal tech of the
  rendering and game engines.

how to lie with statistics

  This is a truly dated book that has an odd style of speech that rambles at
  great length so it can require some serious concentration to get at the core
  of what he is driving at for most chapters. It is also exceptionally light so
  not much is lost attempting to get through it, I suppose. The main theme of
  the book is where people, organisations, teams, researchers, surveyors, and so
  on, manipulate how and which statistical data is presented in order to best
  showcase certain purported "facts".

danish way of parenting

  Nothing exceptional here that a quick glance through the headlines and a few
  paragraphs wouldn't suffice with.

the architecture of happiness

  This was one I read a bit more slowly than the rest. Alain De Boton is an
  intriguing author in how he explores a myriad of different topics in truly
  unique ways. I had previously read his book on Proust and how someone so bed
  ridden could write so well about human pyschology. In this text he explores
  how we tend to look at buildings aesthetically and jabs at modernist notions
  of functionality and science being at the core of building a building. It
  inspired me so much to write Making a Home which is still one of my favourite
  articles.

hello world

  Hannah Fry explores how machine learning is biased and fraught with
  complications that still require human intervention. She rightfully demands a
  truly educated demographic of people who learn to use machine learning as a
  tool rather than a drop-in replacement for human decision making. Machine
  learning, as it is naively applied today, tends to reify particular biases and
  sentiments encoded in prior statistical judgements made by man. Instead, we
  can use machine learning to expose our biases and better tweak our models to
  reflect the kind of world we want to live in (one that doesn't put people in
  an odd place at an odd time).

a mind at play

  I liked learning about Claude Shannon but this was tricky to get through.
  Claude is the founding fathers of information theory (the notion that forms of
  data can be expressed with a single language, binary data, rather than by
  distinct formats for each type of information transfer, e.g. a different
  methodology and format for pictures than as for audio). Shannon worked at Bell
  Labs for a good portion of his life, liked to juggle and do mathematical
  puzzles, and had an overall incredible ability to handle statistical nad
  probabliity related mathematics, helping in with world war efforts. However,
  the book, whether the way it was written or simply the dryness of his overall
  accomplishments, was not that exciting to get through.

Database Internals

  Technical books are hard to review because what may work for one person may
  not work for another. Sometimes you need something as a heavy reference that
  you'll be rifling through often and without any clear ordering, and other
  times you may be looking for exactly a tutorial that starts and ends with a
  clear path (like a university course). "Database Internals" has a _lot_ of
  knowledge and it also does some of the best concise explanation of particular
  database concepts I've seen in books/videos/etc. so it straddles the line
  between reference book and tutorial, but in a way I think is appealing to more
  voracious students on the subject. If you're looking for a simpler explanation
  of internals of databases with less meat or details there is the [CMU Database
  course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnBsf2rH-K7pn09rb3qvkA/playlists)
