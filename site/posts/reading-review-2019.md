This year came up at roughly sixty books "consumed". I've pared the list here
down to about forty.. I say "consumed" because I decided to give audio books a
go. So while I would normally read about thirty books, I've managed to double
that amount by listening to things while I work.

Things of note:

* It may seem obvious (or not?) that there is a tremendous amount of noise out
  there but I'd like to specify that **there is _a lot_ of fluff out there in
  what we choose and are asked to read**.

    * The best books were too complex and deep to truly grok in a single pass,
      but still lucid enough to catch on core points in that first pass. I call
      this quality "replayability".

    * Worst books were shallow and forgettable.

    * Overcoming the discomfort of skimming and skipping through books has had a
      remarkable impact on helping me tackle material I'm requested to ingest.

    * I found a lot of value in taking notes during or after reading. I heard
      once that spending a brief period (specifically thirty seconds, but that
      feels _too_ short) of time to summarize recently received information, no
      matter how complex.

* When I found a book truly worth its weight, I would buy a physical copy to
  review sections.

* Of notable mention are Naval Ravikant's tweet storm and podcasts on [How to Get
  Rich (without getting lucky)](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936?lang=en).

* Two particularly inspiring non-technical blog posts were [Speed
  Matters](https://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters) and [More People Should
  Write](https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write). I also felt a
  kinship for Alexis King's process described in [Parse, Don't
  Validate.](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/).

* I found it useful to read contrarian takes on subjects so that I'm not stuck
  in my own bubble of thought.

Onto some short blurbs on what I've read. These are no replacements for properly
reading the texts, but they may give you an idea of some core concepts and
provide some interest for diving into some (or avoiding others).

####[People's History of Computing In The United States](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38502098-a-people-s-history-of-computing-in-the-united-states)

  A fabulous recount about the history of time sharing computing systems in the
  united states. I found the exploration of the social and economic contexts of
  how these large-scale systems rose up fascinating. Easily goes in the
  collection of great narrative historical stories of computing along with Soul
  of a New Machine.

Unix: A History and Memoire

  For the *nix fans out there this is a wonderful telling of the people involved
  in the makings of Unix at Bell Labs. Brian Kernighan has written several books
  that are always fun to get through: The Awk Programming Language, The C
  Programming Language, The Go Programming Language, and so on. Learning that
  Ken Thompson wrote the prototype of what would become Unix in three weeks
  absolutely blew my mind.

The Rational Optimist

  The thesis of this book is that although things seem bleak in our current
  state of human affairs, especially in regards to the knock-on effects of
  capitalism, the degradation of the environment, and rampant political
  fracturing, we are actually in a far better place than we were before now.
  Ridley proposes that bartering is what makes us distinct from other animals
  and that our ability to form markets and labour has allowed us to accelerate
  advancement of our day-to-day lives.

Influence

  There's about six-ish things that Caildini focuses on as pillars of influence
  on humans. By taking various roles and exploring each concept in relation to
  the presumed job, Caildini explores things like scarcity, consistency,
  attractiveness, providing reasons to requests, etc. Caldaini's original
  framing of the book was to help provide tips so people could better understand
  how to combat the effects of influence but it seems like it has become a
  reference as a means of understanding a subset of persuasion on others.

God's Debris

  Thought experiment where a parcel carrier has a series of discussions with
  God. Deep (and quick) enough for a read.

Platform

  Johnson's argument is that you are only truly an expert in a field if you hold
  a reputation for it. A reputation is only built by putting work into gaining
  an audience (platform). She outlines several ideas and approaches for doing
  this digitally.

Beyond Religion

  The Dalai Lama examines various topics of life from a consciously secular
  standpoint.

The Courage To Be Disliked

  A discourse about Adlerian psychology expressed as a young-man/old-man
  dialogue which is trite. I found the various concepts (especially that of
  people inventing their dramas) to be particularly intriguing. In the story
  they explore the concept that other people have desires that they expect of us
  but we ought to ignore them and instead focus on our freedom to react to
  events however we truly prefer.

The Purple Cow

  Remarkable things sell. If you don't have a remarkable thing, you ought to
  find one to sell. If you have a remarkable thing, don't pretend the effect
  will last forever.

To Sell Is Human

  No matter your career selling is a part of it. You must convince people with
  resources to part with them, usually in exchange for something else. This
  thesis is not dissimilar from The Rational Optimist.

The Autobiography of Gucci Mane

  This was highly ranked in recommendations for marketing but I'm not sure why.
  Gucci Mane explains his upbringing, his entry into rap, the continual
  inclusion of criminal activity and drugs (especially 'lean'), all while
  achieving stellar success. The book finishes with him being fully incarcerated
  and going through a period of withdrawal where he realizes he wants to
  properly abandon drugs and turn his life around.

Born Standing Up

  Incredible autobiography about Steve Martin's adventure through standup and
  eventual explosion of fame (and his disgust of it thanks to his
  dissatisfaction of the isolation it caused). It's interesting to note his
  exploration of his standup style and career as a serious business endeavour
  rather than coming off as part of his 'art'.

Hacking Growth

  A cut-and-dry prescription approach to "growth hacking" and the book that
  claims to have been authored by its inventors. Business intelligence is
  definitely far older. and I wound up finding the book a chore to get through.

The Mom Test

  People will lie to you to feel good about themselves when asked questions
  about your product. Your Mom does the same when you ask her, too. Your goal is
  to get past the fanciful future uses that people love to labour on about and
  focus on the actual pain they've experienced when dealing with a particular
  problem or competitors product. You want to know how you can help ail these
  pain points.

This is Marketing

  Godin argues that marketing is actually good for us; marketing directs us to
  products that change our lives for the (arguably) better position and helps
  normalize this behaviour.

Extreme Ownership

  If you have direct reports and they fail, it's always back on you to teach
  them (unless they truly are inept). It's a long book with many drawn-out
  combat stories filling in the bulk.

Never Split the Difference

  Many fantastic tidbits of negotiation techniques. Some of these are drawn from
  other sources but it's how Voss connects the concepts to practical usage I
  found particularly helpful.

Essentialism

  Lots of great little points on the "less is more" rhetoric.

Anything You Want

  Tells the story of Darek Sivers, the fella who unintentionally built CDBaby
  and eventually sold the company at $12m. This was quick and had lots of great
  point, like the higher leverage obtained by keeping teams small.

Principles

  Divided into two sections, principles discusses life and work principles, the
  latter being far larger but the former being the most applicable for the
  general public in my opinion. You can watch and read most of his material
  without buying his book online as his emphasis isn't making money off the book
  but sharing his knowledge (or so he claims). I've found it to be a fantastic
  trove of knowledge that seems to come up in several other books I've read
  without being Yet Another Business or Self-Help book and without being Get
  Rich Quick themed.

Black Swan

  I did not know about Nassim Taleb until this year when a mentor of mine
  mentioned he was also reading him. Taleb, a former quantitative analyst,
  explores the concept of the Black Swan, a highly improbable, but not
  impossible, event, under the auspices that any attempt to claim that
  predictions are rock-solid is a farce. The classic example he gives early in
  the book is about a turkey who seems to be living the grand life, only to be
  later killed (the black swan event). One connected idea I found particularly
  intriguing is that of randomness being really about the observer of the random
  variable: the turkey may not know about the black swan event but the farmer
  who owns the turkey knows about this date for month.

The Culture Code

  People are productive when they feel safe and, therefore, can be vulnerable.
  They are also more creative and innovative. This is fundamentally Maslow's
  hierarchy of needs but he also discusses the emphasis of sharing goals in
  tandem with sharing vulnerability. One of the better books outlining why you
  want to structure a business culture with these characteristics.

Rework

  Your work isn't everything and ought not to control you. A well-rested and
  clear-headed employee stays longer at a company and is wildly more productive
  than the run-down equivalent. I liked the idea of "JOMO" (Joy of Missing Out)
  being pushed in comparison to the usual sense of "FOMO" people experience. I
  usually like Jason Fried and DHH books because they are full of lots
  "common-sense" knowledge that are still helpful to be reminded of.

Alibaba

  A rather bland telling of Jack Ma's growing of his various business interests
  and, later, Alibaba. His translation work and early interest in the internet
  helped eventually leading to his starting of Alibaba. There were many
  "everything store" styled shops and Jack's early translation company did far
  more than translation services, selling whatever they could.

Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman

  Feynman is a mixed bag. He is quick witted and smart but is also a creep. His
  autobiography paints a picture of a happy-go-lucky, curious-minded,
  exploration-driven individual who loves to prank, be a smart alec, and isn't
  shy to discuss his interest in women as well as visitations to strip clubs
  where he would draw the strippers and work on physics problems. That said, it
  is interesting to look at how Feynman is always deducing from other facts or
  principles which you can see in the way the text is written (also notable in
  his lectures).

No Hard Feelings

  An exploration into how to accept that emotions are always apart of our lives
  and decisions, including at work, and how to use that knowledge to best
  effect. Also a good reminder that our work is not everything.

When Things Fall Apart

  A discussion from a Buddhist monk about how chaos is inevitable and how we
  must, no matter how stable we think life is, continually invite "chaos in with
  a cup of tea" if we are truly to handle what life has to throw at us.

Turn The Ship Around!

  A naval captain tells how he managed to change from a top-down organisational
  structure into something with more autonomy amongst the ranks, helping turn
  one of the worst ranked teams into one of the best. The "I intend to" language
  is gold, alone, but there are other techniques explained throughout the book
  as it covers the discovery of these in relation to particular organisational
  problems they were facing. For example, to deal with better handling
  operational concerns on the submarine, they begin practicing deliberate action
  where they vocalise what they are about to do, gesture at the subject that
  will be acted upon, and, after a short pause, perform the task.

Ultralearning

  Discusses a form of learning where progress and speed are the focus;
  compressing learning into short bursts at a time to positive effect. I have
  mixed feelings about this book after having come out of therapy this last year
  because I am into this processes but I felt the emphasis of an always-on
  approach isn't healthy for long-term learning as well as general psychological
  health.

Inner Engineering

  Particularly memorable parts of the book include reminding oneself of their
  mortality to help prioritise what truly matters and that taking responsibility
  is about taking charge of our ability to respond to life and events around us.

Atomic Habits

  Although nothing _new_ is prescribed here, I applaud Clear with compiling a
  simple compendium of core concepts that fuel habit formation. All the
  worksheets and activities I ignore but the four points are well worth the
  extra bit of reading to cement the ideas.

Nonviolent Communication

  This one is considered a classic in that it is commonly referenced as being a
  big part of negotiation and interpersonal relationships discourse.
  Rosenfield's foundations are that failure to recognise needs, of our own and
  of others, is the crux of interpersonal conflict.

Art and Fear

  This one is great as it applies to areas of work outside of creating artwork.
  I found this incredibly useful in terms of recognising that quantity is much
  more valuable for the effort of learning (experimentation) than is focusing on
  quality upfront. Other people's magic is not your own so don't go attempting
  to copy in hopes that you'll achieve the same results. In the same train of
  thought, only compare your development to your own history.

Why we Sleep

  Most of us know sleep deprivation is problematic but this book goes deeper in
  how debilitating it can truly be, as well as how little sleep deprivation is
  required before achieving ill effects.

Range

  Being an expert usually is less effective than being a jack of all trades.
  Why? Because experts go down deep holes that start to lose innovation as they
  make less and less cross-disciplinary connections.

Daring Greatly

  Being courageous means sharing. We tend to think its the other way; that
  sharing _takes_ courage, but in reality if you share, you are being
  courageous. Brown calls sharing so much information that your intent is to
  manipulate others "oversharing".

How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big

  Systems over goals. Energy drives success which drives passion, not the other
  way around. A varied collection of ideas and memoirs of how Scott Adams built
  various aspects of his career and had lots of little failures testing out
  ideas and going through a life as a cubicle jockey.

Infinite powers

  Absolutely wonderful exploration of the history and internals of calculus.
  Strogatz is the author of Sync, Non-linear Dynamics and Chaos, The Joy of X,
  and others. He has a knack for breathing life into mathematical subjects. I
  found his historical bits just as exciting as exciting as the clarity of his
  explanations for the inner workings of calculus.

101 things I learned from (urban planning|architecture|advertising|engineering) school

  I have several of these '101 things' books. They are a breeze to get through
  (some of the points are just quotes, or usually short blurbs, less than two,
  on average about one, paragraphs each) and often about 2-4% of those points
  are absolute gold. One that is off the top of my head from recently finishing
  the advertising version of the series is the notion that you should emphasis
  getting your message across as many people as possible if it applies to a
  broad reach (say, toilet paper) while a specific niche demographic is best hit
  with higher frequency.

Game Engine Blackbook (Wolf 3D|DOOM)

  These are fabulous books and if you have any nostalgia for the games they
  cover whatsoever, and you program, you should pick them up without a moments
  hesitation. They cover a portion of history regarding product development,
  hardware, and follow naturally into solid analysis of the internal tech of the
  rendering and game engines.

How To Lie With Statistics

  This is a truly dated book that has an odd style of speech that rambles at
  great length so it can require some serious concentration to get at the core
  of what he is driving at for most chapters. It is also exceptionally light so
  not much is lost attempting to get through it, I suppose. The main theme of
  the book is where people, organisations, teams, researchers, surveyors, and so
  on, manipulate and confuse statistical data.

Danish Way of Parenting

  Nothing exceptional here that a quick glance through the headlines and a few
  paragraphs wouldn't suffice with.

The Architecture of Happiness

  This was one I read a bit more slowly than the rest. Alain De Boton is an
  intriguing author in how he explores a myriad of different topics in truly
  unique ways. I had previously read his book on Proust and how someone so bed
  ridden could write so well about human pyschology. In this text he explores
  how we tend to look at buildings aesthetically and jabs at modernist notions
  of functionality and science being at the core of architecture. It inspired me
  so much to write [Make a
  Home](https://www.justanotherdot.com/posts/make-a-home.html) which is still
  one of my favourite articles.

Hello World

  Fry explores how machine learning amplifies our biases. She argues that we can
  actively expose and rectify these biases and use machine learning to
  supplement human judgement rather than replacing it entirely.

A Mind at Play

  I liked learning about Claude Shannon but this was tricky to get through as
  the writing was a bit bland. Claude is the founding father of information
  theory (the notion that different forms of data can be expressed with binary
  data). Shannon worked at Bell Labs for a good portion of his life, liked to
  juggle, ride a unicycle, and do mathematical puzzles. Apparently he had a
  knack for statistics and probability, too, to the point which he obsessively
  analysed gambling odds for roulette and had a knack for markets and building
  precursory computing machines.

Database Internals

  Technical books are hard to review because what may work for one person may
  not work for another. Sometimes you need something as a heavy reference that
  you'll be rifling through often and without any clear ordering, and other
  times you may be looking for exactly a tutorial that starts and ends with a
  clear path (like a university course). "Database Internals" has a _lot_ of
  knowledge _and_ concise explanations of database concepts so it straddles the
  line between reference book and tutorial, but in a way I think is appealing to
  more voracious students on the subject. If you're looking for a simpler
  explanation of internals of databases with less meat or details there is the
  [CMU Database
  course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnBsf2rH-K7pn09rb3qvkA/playlists)
