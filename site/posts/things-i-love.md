It has taken me awhile to summarise 2022. I intended to finish writing my book,
"Just Perf", but family took precedence, as it always should. Instead, I
drastically improved my curation skills, and did get a lot of writing practice
in, while also honing my craft at work. 

Admittedly, I was feeling a bit burnt-out, as one does from time to time working
in tech, and I decided at the start of 2022 that I would commit to making the
things I love *explicit*. Every time I found something I loved, into a note it
went. Bear has this neat functionality on mobile I use a lot, where the `share`
functionality can be chosen to append to the end of a note. This is handy for
general link dumping, but in this case it it allowed me to focus media to a
particular bucket, as you can edit the text before dumping if you want. Doing
this sharpened my sensibilities, and I've since taken the practice for other
things in my life that I want to be sure of what is uniquely _me_ and not simply
me copying others templates. I also had read The Practice by Seth Godin in which
he has a small section dedicated to adopting an abundance mindset; I love the
idea of holding onto an abundance mindset now, and I think hoarding a treasure
trove of what I love is the wrong thing to do, hence I am here sharing it with
you, dear reader.

It is now nearing the end of of the first month of 2023, and I felt it
appropriate to get on with it and share this list. Things will inevitably
change, and this list may contian things I will fall out of love with, but
that's ok; I'm human and I'm growing. I will gradually refine this list to more
than a link dump as a I revisit the content and reflect. I will be repeating
this process again, and, indeed, there are some links at the tail end of this
list that were thrown in this January. Hopefully you can mind a bit of my mess
as I clean things up in public, but feel free to come back and see how things
have changed. This foreword will likely adapt as time goes on, too. We need more
living documents.

**NB.** *With the inevitable collapse of twitter on its way, many of these twitter
links will be converted into screenshots for posterity. I also am keen on the
idea that if it doesn't fit in a screenshot or two, I don't think it's small
enough to love.*

Without further ado:
