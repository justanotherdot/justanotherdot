          &lt;p&gt;As part of &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.justanotherdot.com/posts/the-lowly-assert.html&quot;&gt;The Lowly
Assert&lt;/a&gt; series I
wanted to go over some mathematical patterns. Filling your arsenal of known
properties helps with recognizing common ways functions, systems, etc. are, and
should continue, to behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally you&#x27;ll write functions that flip-flop: when you call the function
multiple times in a row, chunks seem to cancel out. Mathematics calls these
functions &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)&quot;&gt;&quot;involutive&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Negating a number or a boolean twice gets you back
to the original value. Involution is handy to recognize because it&#x27;s a simple
assertion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;x &#x3D;&#x3D; f(f(x))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic property based testing example of this is the
&lt;code&gt;reverse(reverse(some_list))&lt;/code&gt; you&#x27;ll see in endless tutorials and getting
started guides on the subject. When you reverse a list you expect to simply flip
the contents one end to the other, but this may not be immediately applicable to
day-to-day affairs. Here&#x27;s one: a function that opens a dialogue box has two
states, open and closed, and is commonly tested for involutivity; if you didn&#x27;t
have the toggling action you&#x27;d see no feedback after clicking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But involution doesn&#x27;t have to be about functions applied exactly twice.
Rotating around a point back to an original direction can be done with various
divisions: two rotations of pi, four rotations of pi/2, and so on. Precisely,
involution requires that the application be a single function, but we can
sometimes be a bit less rigorous and claim that two or more actions that
eventually cancel out are involutive: removing and adding an item in a
collection or returning someone&#x27;s money in an exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this we can hopefully see the application isn&#x27;t on any end of the scale:
from small to big, XORing bits to whole product flows that might &#x27;restart&#x27; the
user in a funnel. Properties like these are worth their weight in gold because
they are useful in almost any type of testing and are definitely a shining
example of The Lowly Assert.&lt;/p&gt;
