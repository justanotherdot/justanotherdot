          &lt;p&gt;If you&#x27;re coming from a language that supports automatically taking references
to arguments you may wonder why Rust can&#x27;t do the same. Rust is all about giving
developers a better control of the memory layout of the data in their programs.
Since Rust has the notion of ownership, we don&#x27;t have to worry about large
objects being copied into a function when the arguments to a function are owned.
Instead, they are moved (pass-by-move), and when I first started writing Rust I
assumed the idiom was to always use owned types for function arguments. For
clarity, we call something an &quot;owned&quot; typed when it isn&#x27;t behind a reference
(&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;). When an argument is behind a reference, we call that a &quot;borrowed&quot; type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Idiomatic Rust functions ought to borrow arguments unless a function needs to
completely own an argument for ergonomics (say, method chaining) or allocation
(the caller won&#x27;t need to re-use the data, perhaps).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#x27;s the case against owned types for function arguments as the default? All
data in Rust must have an owner and that owner is a variable. Function arguments
are variables. This means that when you give a function an owned type, you force
a caller to give away ownership of the data it has allocated and probably wanted
to use further down the line. If the function doesn&#x27;t give back the value, it is
lost to the caller, and the memory will be de-allocated at the end of the call&#x27;s
scope. Often callers &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to keep ownership of the values they pass into
functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immutable borrows let functions decide if they want to make selective
allocations but that does mean a function may be allocating when the caller may
want to know all allocations upfront. Owned types are a good fit for this as it
is the caller&#x27;s responsibility to allocate and give up ownership to the function
for its use. &lt;em&gt;Alternatively&lt;/em&gt;, if a function wants to make a change (mutate) an
argument, it will be clear to the caller that data may change signaled by adding
&lt;code&gt;mut&lt;/code&gt; after the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;. The common practice in C is to take pointers to
non-primitive values. This is done so large objects don&#x27;t get copied on each
function call. However, with this approach of using raw pointers there is no way
to clarify when a pointer is simply going to read data and when it is going to
change it. With borrowed types in Rust we get this clarity at the syntactic
level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idiomatic Rust functions borrow arguments unless it truly needs to own the
values or they are primitives.&lt;/strong&gt; Rust copies primitive values as they are part
of the &lt;code&gt;Copy&lt;/code&gt; trait. And this isn&#x27;t to say you should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; take owned
arguments. The &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/ownership/builders.html&quot;&gt;builder
pattern&lt;/a&gt;
explicitly takes ownership and gives it back at each method call, allowing us to
chain together calls prior to a &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; assignment. If we used &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mut self&lt;/code&gt; instead
we&#x27;d need to first assign the value with &lt;code&gt;let mut&lt;/code&gt; and make the calls
separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to an interesting example: How would we write the inside of this
function?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fn thin_air() -&amp;gt; &amp;amp;Vec&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt; {
    unimplemented!()
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could try to allocate and take a reference to the allocation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fn thin_air() -&amp;gt; &amp;amp;Vec&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt; {
    &amp;amp;vec![]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the borrow checker will refuse this program because our &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;/code&gt; only exists
for the scope of &lt;code&gt;thin_air&lt;/code&gt; and if we held a reference after the point it was
dropped (its memory is freed) we&#x27;d be holding a pointer to garbage which is not
safe to read or write to. Thus, if we want to return a borrowed type, we must
also take a borrowed type or something that holds a borrowed type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct&amp;lt;&#x27;a&amp;gt; Data {
  integers: &amp;amp;&#x27;a Vec&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt;
}

fn thin_air(data: Data) -&amp;gt; &amp;amp;Vec&amp;lt;i32&amp;gt; {
  data.integers
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap, Rust cares about memory safety and layout a fair amount and puts the
work on the programmer to decide when references to arguments should be taken.
Choosing immutable borrows by default means you won&#x27;t cause any unintended
consequences besides maybe some stray allocations. If you want to change the
content that the caller owns and, hence, has allocated, switch to a mutable
borrow. Lastly, if you know the caller won&#x27;t need the argument anymore or if it
wants to return an owned type in exchange of the passed in argument(s), the
function ought to take ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
