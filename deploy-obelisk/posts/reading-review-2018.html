          &lt;p&gt;Being a voracious reader, one thing that helps bring the mountain of things I
want to read down to something manageable is being able to read things faster.
Reading &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; itself probably hurts comprehension and digestion of core
concepts, but getting digested content from others who have already read the
main body of work can drastically reduce the amount of fluff you&#x27;ll have to wade
through yourself. If you&#x27;ve ever read a book review that basically told you
everything you needed to know before you&#x27;ve read the book, you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m
talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve personally felt this way a lot towards reviews and have found it
invaluable. As such, I feel it&#x27;s necessary for me to pay this back. It&#x27;s not
worthwhile giving rundowns for &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; I&#x27;ve read so the purpose of this
article is to focus on the things I&#x27;ve found fascinating. This is by no means a
comprehensive list and you&#x27;ll probably find the details per body of work a tad
thin as time has waned on since I&#x27;ve read them. However, I do wish to make this
more of a regular habit and, in the end, hopefully I can at least express the
delight I&#x27;ve had getting through some of these wonderful wading pools of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/1430219483/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;amp;qid&#x3D;1544954623&amp;amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;amp;keywords&#x3D;coders+at+work&quot;&gt;Coders at Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This had so many fantastic insights into programming in the large as well as the
small for some of my heroes as well as some people I had never heard of before.
Of particular note was the recurring question Peter Seibel kept bringing up:
&quot;How do you read code?&quot;. In fact, Seibel even did a follow-up blog post on the
subject, but my particular take was the specifics that people actually replied
with. In fact, the subject matter drove me to write an article about reading
code I dubbed &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://justanotherdot.com/posts/Reading_Code_is_Decoding.html&quot;&gt;&#x27;Reading Code is
Decoding&#x27;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing I thought fascinating was that one of the leaders of the Haskell
language, Simon Peyton Jones, had feelings towards types as proof systems that
were less intense as I had originally assumed. In fact, SPJ repeatedly mentions
that the idea is about &lt;em&gt;confidence&lt;/em&gt; and not about mathematical fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, guys like Brad Fitzpatrick and Jamie Zawinski &#x27;got things done&#x27;, but
they also had a lot of sensibility towards quality instead of simply being
&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/09/23/the-duct-tape-programmer/&quot;&gt;&#x27;duct tape
programmers&#x27;.&lt;/a&gt;
In my mind, the book does a phenomenal job of showing how several people can
think of simplicity from different angles, whether that&#x27;s avoiding the barbarism
of C++ in the face of Netscape&#x27;s pre-existing C codebase, avoiding unnecessary
enterprise software in exchange for possibly less-than-ideal open-source
solutions to keep Live Journal up and running, or sussing out obtuse assembly
language for an unknown system by mathematically dissecting hunks of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;amp;qid&#x3D;1544954644&amp;amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;amp;keywords&#x3D;the+manager%27s+path&quot;&gt;The Manager&#x27;s Path&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft skills are hard, and we&#x27;ll see in a few other reviews that they are even
harder to write about and absolutely harder to put into practice properly! But
that still doesn&#x27;t mean people can&#x27;t try. Things of note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will sometimes need to do hard things and tell people hard news, but it&#x27;s
better you do that than try to pretend everything is amazing. In other words,
It&#x27;s better to be &#x27;kind&#x27; (honest but considerate) than simply &#x27;nice&#x27; (always
accommodating)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may find yourself with more managerial duties, you&#x27;re ability to bridge
the gap between technical and non-technical members of the business increases;
this can be with metrics and even how you handle explaining or using
alternative jargon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy codebase is an active one, but the rate of change needs to be kept
in check with the rate of errors. There is a subtle hint here about developing
a devops culture so that people are aware of how they can best help ship
software and know if they are within a predefined error budget. If you impede
the error budget, it&#x27;s time to start focusing more on fixing things, which
means having flexible scheduling percentages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning is the most vital aspect of a business and orienting it&#x27;s processes
around it is pivotal in it&#x27;s success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having technical chops before you wind up in any managerial capacity is
crucial but it&#x27;s also important to know that things like leadership and
empathy takes just as much effort to refine and perfect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like a good follow up to this was reading John Allspaw&#x27;s article &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Being a Senior Engineer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
In it, Allspaw hits on several soft skills that &#x27;senior&#x27; software engineers
absolutely must uphold on a day to day basis, and I really don&#x27;t see them being
that different from soft skills that others should be upholding as well as they
increase in seniority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology&quot;&gt;Choose Boring Tech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.intercom.com/blog/run-less-software/&quot;&gt;Run Less Software&lt;/a&gt;, and [You Need a Novelty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budget](https://www.shimweasel.com/2018/08/25/novelty-budgets)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention these three articles in tandem because they were thoughts I had
faintly felt being in various organisations but could not pinpoint with words
quite as well as these three articles do. The core ideas are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#x27;t always need to map every problem to an ideal solution, in fact,
doing so is problematic because you will wind up with too much tech to
maintain, and maintenance cost must weight in considering adoption&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every new piece of tech you acquire into your stack means more things people
need to know about and the more people need to know means the less they can be
experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing or building swanky libraries, technology, and services may be
exhilarating but it&#x27;s also problematic for the above reasons. Having a
&#x27;novelty budget&#x27; can help prevent &#x27;fancy tech creep&#x27; into the codebase and
infrastructure. In fact, it may help to run as many crazy projects &#x27;on the
side&#x27; (i.e. outside of work) as possible to help reduce the urge of
introducing shiny-new-things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept going back to these articles at least every month or two; they serve as a
basis of what I think is productive coding: write boring code that &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;4Y0tOi7QWqM&quot;&gt;fits in your
head&lt;/a&gt;, is heavily tested, focuses
on some clear specification (the proper abstraction), and satisfies &quot;small is
beautiful/less is more&quot;. I can&#x27;t imagine that being the end of the proper
characteristics and that list keeps morphing as I keep coding, but it seems
sensible enough to mention those characteristics in relation to these posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Twelve-Steps-Compassionate-Karen-Armstrong-ebook/dp/B003WUYPBA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;amp;qid&#x3D;1544954743&amp;amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;amp;keywords&#x3D;12+steps+to+a+compassionate+life&quot;&gt;12 Steps to a Compassionate Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For trust to cultivate between members working together to build impossible
programs and systems you need respect and you can&#x27;t build respect until you have
empathy for others. You don&#x27;t need to feel the same thing they feel, per se, but
compassion itself is, in my mind and shaped from the sentiments in the book, the
difficult but extremely rewarding practice of cultivating concern for others,
their suffering and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book, Armstrong equips us with a particular process of better developing
empathy for others via religious, sociological, and psychological references.
Since this is a heavy process-oriented book, I can&#x27;t simply give a quick tl;dr,
but I do want to recommend this book heavily. It and &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Kids-Will-Listen-ebook/dp/B005GG0MXI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;amp;qid&#x3D;1544953942&amp;amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;amp;keywords&#x3D;how+to+talk&quot;&gt;How to Talk so Kids Will
Listen and Listen so Kids Will
Talk&lt;/a&gt;
are both fantastic resources on this subject, although I&#x27;ve read the latter a
number of years before this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/08/20/filter-before-you-parse-faster-analytics-on-raw-data-with-sparser/&quot;&gt;Filter Before you Parse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Morning Paper is probably &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; best resource for mind blowing information
on the internet for software engineers, and I could ramble off many articles
that absolutely twisted my brain this year. If you don&#x27;t have a subscription to
the The Morning Paper, you need to go subscribe this instance! Despite it not
being the most mind-bending of articles this year, I wanted to point out this
particular piece and associated paper because it&#x27;s such a &quot;oh &lt;strong&gt;of course&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;
kind of moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist? Do a fast search on the JSON payload &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; transforming it into
it&#x27;s in-memory representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://lemire.me/blog/2018/05/03/how-fast-can-you-parse-json/&quot;&gt;How Fast Can You Parse JSON?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Lemire is a performance and database nut (and so I&#x27;m easily a fan). I
wanted to include this since I had also included the JSON parsing related paper
from The Morning Paper. In this short article, Daniel explores a few industrial
grade parser implementations and tries to get at how many cycles it would take
to parse per byte, eventually coming to the closing line of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you should expect to spend 2 or 3 seconds parsing one gigabyte of JSON data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am personally a fan of &quot;Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know&quot; and I
think things like this are actually handy, back pocket facts that ease
estimation, s.t. if you find you&#x27;re parsing a gigabyte of JSON and it&#x27;s taking
orders of magnitude more than this, you can probably know there are gains to be
made, and also know that there might be a happy limit for optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://charity.wtf/2018/08/19/shipping-software-should-not-be-scary/&quot;&gt;Shipping Software Shouldn&#x27;t be Scary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a number female software engineer role models; Julia Evans, Jessie
Frazelle, and Charity Majors, to name a few. Charity&#x27;s kick is on empowering
devs to be both coding and operations gurus by empowering them with the
superpower of observability. This article by Charity also goes into some core
things about operational concerns that are &quot;everyone&#x27;s problems&quot;. The hot take
is that devs should be able to take code from cradle to grave; ideation into
production which entails all the messy debugging and reversals after Things Go
Wrong. The aim is to make everyone a software owner rather than a mere
occasional participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may also get the reward for the best work memes of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://gist.github.com/bcantrill/835837a66bcc21b899f501dd794a7d5f&quot;&gt;Bryan Cantril&#x27;s &#x27;internal&#x27; doc on hiring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryan sums this up nicely in the beginning, I&#x27;ll add my takeaways for each bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aptitude: can the person actually code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education: have they persevered through boring lectures and stress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivation: are you driven to write code everyday or is it Just Another Job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values, per the doc itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One observation is that one&#x27;s values -- and the adherence or divergence from
those values -- will often be reflected in happiness and satisfaction with
work. When work strongly reflects one&#x27;s values, one is much more likely to
find it satisfying; when values are compromised (even if for a good reason),
work is likely be unsatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrity: The usual verification that people are who they say they are and
not actually crazy, serial axe murders or simply bullshit artists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://lethain.com/migrations/&quot;&gt;Migrations: the sole scalable fix to tech debt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have legacy technology and you wish it would just go away, but how are you
going to euthanize it? You could write a new system and hide the other one in
the corner, perhaps? But you end up realising that your business relies quite
heavily to this chunk of code and that it&#x27;s actually grown into such a mess you
can&#x27;t fathom now moving away from it entirely and now need to run two things;
this is a fairly common problem and I think the gist of this article was spot
on: if you want to deprecate A, you need to be focused and clear about how B is
going to entirely replace it&#x27;s functionality to the point where it can be
politely deleted out of existence, and you need to make this a common practice
as an engineering team as every piece of code you write is legacy the moment you
write it. Code rots, and, as such, that shiny new piece of tech you&#x27;ve just
built will one day need a successor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general the process is the same for any piece of software: do upfront
planning with documentation and good old fashioned thinking, get people on
board, don&#x27;t be the machine and automate as much of the migration as possible,
help &lt;em&gt;track&lt;/em&gt; the actual shift away from the older platform, and finally, don&#x27;t
forget to celebrate your achievements! That last one is huge because if you
don&#x27;t make migrations a big deal, people won&#x27;t see the value in it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Without-Bullshit-Career-Saying-ebook/dp/B01A5CEKQM/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;amp;qid&#x3D;1544955550&amp;amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;amp;keywords&#x3D;writing+without+bullshit&quot;&gt;Writing Without Bullshit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m actually quite surprised that this book devolved into a description of a
particular process, but I think it&#x27;s a worthy ally in the fight to cut the fat
out of one&#x27;s prose (the emphasis is in a workplace setting). Two major things of
note I took from this book were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be short and to the point but scrutinize your use of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly useful to get out &#x27;fat outlines&#x27; of work before you start
obsessing on details and get lost in the subsequent worrying. I write like
this now in general: large bulk of content upfront and several passes of
refinement afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#x27;iron imperative&#x27;: &quot;Don&#x27;t waste the readers time&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last point kept having me think about the book &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;amp;qid&#x3D;1544955670&amp;amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;amp;keywords&#x3D;don%27t+make+me+think&quot;&gt;Don&#x27;t Make
Me&lt;/a&gt;
Think where the crux of design should be about alleviating cognitive load on the
user of the interface. It&#x27;s a powerful phrase to have handy when needing to
point out really lengthy bits of code, comments, or documentation, as well as
general communiques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Messy-Power-Disorder-Transform-Lives-ebook/dp/B01BD1SU2E/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;amp;qid&#x3D;1544955751&amp;amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;amp;keywords&#x3D;messy+the+power&quot;&gt;Messy: The Power of Disorder to Transform Our Lives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was monumental in getting me comfortable with the idea of doing rough
groundwork upfront. In fact, some people describe this as the &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle&quot;&gt;&#x27;paeto
principle&#x27;&lt;/a&gt; where &#x27;eighty
percent of the work comes from twenty percent of the effort&#x27;. In my mind I&#x27;m
sure Pareto never intended this to be about a specific ratio but rather about
how a small portion of input winds up relating to a large portion of the output.
I actually found no better succinct description of the book except at the start
(the rest is still worth the read):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument of this book is that we often succumb to the temptation of a
tidy-minded approach when we would be better served by embracing a degree of
mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development/dp/1491927283/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;amp;qid&#x3D;1544955863&amp;amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;amp;keywords&#x3D;programming+rust&quot;&gt;Programming Rust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve not really read a specific programming-language book in awhile, but I love
systems programming and Programming rust (along with several other rust books)
focus heavily on the subject; whether it&#x27;s talking about error handling, rough
edges with Unicode, or even how different languages handle assignment in order
to explain the borrow checker and moves, I was constantly enthralled to pick
this book up despite it being close to six-hundred pages. It&#x27;s gained the
classic &#x27;dirty and crushed pages&#x27; aesthetic and it&#x27;ll probably gain a bit more
as I keep trying to double down on rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;amp;qid&#x3D;1544955948&amp;amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;amp;keywords&#x3D;designing+data-intensive+applications&quot;&gt;Designing Data-Intensive Applications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this book enough. I actually finished reading this near the
end of 2017, but I love it so much that I wanted to write about it here. I
personally don&#x27;t know of any other book that handles the fundamentals of
database internals (along with many modern improvements), database design,
clusters, nodes, schema encodings, discussions around guarantees (CAP, ACID) and
what are valid and invalid points, consensus in distributed systems, and even
modern data processing patterns all while in the context of proposing a credo
that data-intensive applications should uphold, in such an elegant and
ultimately fun way. I still read through the book for knowledge I may have
passed up or forgotten so it&#x27;s a fantastic resource to have on my shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s also dawned on me that data processing &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; programming, and knowing more
and more about data and how to handle it is enlightening and empowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Forth-Leo-Brodie/dp/0976458705/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;amp;qid&#x3D;1544956045&amp;amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;amp;keywords&#x3D;thinking+forth&quot;&gt;Thinking Forth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://twitter.com/lorentzframe/status/997997523301117953&quot;&gt;Brian Beckman wrote a tweet I read awhile
back&lt;/a&gt;, stating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;SICP&quot; by Abelson &amp;amp; Sussman should be read continuously, ~2 pages a day,
returning to page 1 every year. Ditto &quot;Thinking Forth&quot; by Leo Brodie, tho&#x27;
only ~1 page a day. The former teaches how to think, the latter how to
engineer. Both are in unpopular languages, on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and having read most of the SICP, even watching the entire lecture series, but
never having heard of &lt;em&gt;Thinking Forth&lt;/em&gt; (but having heard of the language), I was
intrigued to hear of a book put on the same page as the SICP! I am actually,
also, cheating here as I&#x27;ve read only half of it, but so far it&#x27;s definitely a
different way of looking at software construction in the same vein that the SICP
went to lengths to describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heaviest emphasis made so far in the book that I love seems drawn between
Domain Driven Design and traditional functional programming: words are vital to
how we code, the meaning they carry as well as their surrounding semantics; we
group words into lexicons which we can call &#x27;components&#x27;, and with &#x27;components&#x27;
we get all the general benefits we get from composition. There is some forth
specific information nestled between, but &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://twitter.com/lorentzframe/status/999121431559487489&quot;&gt;Beckman is wise in a followup
tweet&lt;/a&gt;, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If SICP were in, say, (popular) Python instead of (unpopular) Scheme, people
might be distracted by the Python and miss the thinking. Ditto if &quot;Thinking
Forth&quot; were in (popular) Java instead of (unpopular) Forth, people might miss
the deeper points about software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m excited to finish it in January, in tandem with &lt;em&gt;Thinking in Systems: A
Primer&lt;/em&gt;, which I&#x27;ve started just last week and has so far been an amazing way of
perceiving the structure of various systems from a proper, abstracted point of
view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally thought a format involving simple review styled blurbs might be
handy, but it&#x27;s kind of nice having not thought about some of these various
texts for a bit to really see what would stick. I hope this has been somewhat
useful or fun!&lt;/p&gt;
