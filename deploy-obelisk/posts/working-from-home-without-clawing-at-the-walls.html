          &lt;p&gt;Swaths of people are shifting into working from home, otherwise acronymized as
&quot;wfh&quot;, and for some, it&#x27;s a drastic shift. For those with kids, the reduced
productivity will be a change even for those that are used to working from home.
I have a fair amount of experience working from home and I thought I&#x27;d share
some thoughts from my experience of key things that have helped keep me
productive but also, more importantly, sane. After all, long periods locked up
inside can easily drive one to cabin fever; how do all the introverts and remote
workers keep from space madness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome. You are now working from home. You have a computer, a brain, and a way
to link the two, and this is (for purposes of simplifying this article) largely
what you need to get your job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of what I&#x27;m to recommend are peppered with caveats due to the nature of
why people are coming in droves to the practice of working remotely. Take what I
say with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NB. I started writing this on a Sunday and became aware of Alice Goldfuss&#x27;s
&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/work-in-the-time-of-corona/&quot;&gt;fantastic article&lt;/a&gt;
on the same subject the Monday after. It is far more thorough and I strongly
recommend it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wear your work clothes. This is going to set off the &quot;I&#x27;m wearing work
clothes, I&#x27;m going to work&quot; cells firing. Resist the urge to wear the same
clothes you wore last night post-shower and relaxation. There are a few points
here that are about separation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get outside. If you have a morning routine, say with tea or coffee, it can
help to simply exit your house for a brief period in the morning. Getting some
time outside the confines of the walls of your home may seem inconsequential
but I&#x27;ve found it to have a profound impact on my psyche. Lots of these points
may seem like &quot;well of course!&quot; but the reality is that working from home
tends to get you into tunnel vision about work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedicate space to where you work if you can. Productivity can dwindle, and
your ability to relax, if you mix and match places for use of work and
leisure. If you don&#x27;t have the space to dedicate as an office you can always
pick strategic places in your house that are more for business than they are
for recreation. For example, it might be cool to work at the dining table or
the kitchen island but not in bed and on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do a bit of exercise. Doing a small run or bike around the block, some yoga at
home, or doing pushups, situps, and jumping jacks throughout your day in small
spurts can add up. Lack of exercise can lead to a reduction in energy and
alertness but you don&#x27;t need to be doing really heavy exercise to get back
into the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do a bit of stretching at regular intervals. I make this a separate point
because if you work at a computer like me, it&#x27;s vital to remember to get up
and move around constantly and stretch out all the muscles attached your hands
are up in your back, neck, and so on. I also own a foam roller and massage
ball for my back and neck that I use for about ten minutes at the end of each
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work in a high-pace work environment, having lunch at the ready so you
don&#x27;t have to cook it helps reduce stress. Ditto breakfast and dinner
although, in another point we&#x27;ll cover, hours of work can sort of distort a
bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on what you can do, if you do anything with a deep work effort, be
free with how you organize your day during the &quot;deep work&quot; period. There might
be the time where everyone catches up, perhaps with a standup or quick chat,
but the idea is that you should feel a bit freer to, say, read a bit for
fifteen minutes or take a bike ride. This is important because it breaks up
your day and time you reclaim from the commute shouldn&#x27;t all be poured into
work. You need to structure the demarcation of you-time and work-time
responsibly because things like getting on the train won&#x27;t be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a social person, it can help to have things like podcasts and
audiobooks at the ready so you can get an influx of other humans talking into
your daily psyche diet. I call this the morning-television effect. When people
put on morning television it is more to create the presence of people than the
content they broadcast. It can pay to have a little bit of human communication
on a quick ten to fifteen-minute call per day either for work or with a
friend, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, we are basically like plants in that we need water, oxygen, and
light. Getting plenty of these in some form or another improves quality of
life while working from home. This is a bit more than the &quot;get out of the
house&quot; point because it can be done without leaving the home, although getting
out of the house also makes you feel a bit &quot;free&quot; from the confines of your
home as well. Physiological needs can be the first place to try to supplement
and repair when things are feeling funky at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you feel flustered, shut off the computer for a bit. I know not everyone
can do this as some people&#x27;s jobs, say in software operations, need to be
present for most of their clocked time when on duty. If you do have the
option, it is powerful to push your laptop away and go someplace with just
your journal. Once there, try to de-stress a bit and forget work. Once your
head is a bit clear, focus on whatever problem you are dealing with on paper
first. Being indoors is claustrophobic. Being indoors inside the mental space
of a computer is doubly so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A majority of these boil down to a couple of heuristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on your physiological needs when things seem off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure you have routines and structure in place to keep your mind focused&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be flexible with your expectations on yourself and on your work,
particularly concerning where hours are dedicated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this it&#x27;s a stressful period. Go easy on yourself and those around
you while everyone adjusts. I hope some points here help ease the adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
